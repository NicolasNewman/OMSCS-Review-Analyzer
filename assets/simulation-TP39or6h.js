If you struggle with a practice exam question, make a note of it, and mark it down on your cheat sheet. Every so often I see myself revising the cheat sheet all again and again due to the feedback I got when doing the practice finals. If you think that 2 practice exams isn't enough, I'd go and look up textbooks that cover the same math and stats content as what is being taught in Sim. (Make sure it covers RVs, Prob Dist, etc) and do those questions. Honestly Sim is just a math course with  applications using ARENA. Also,
I'd recommend getting a good scientific calculator and leverage their stat's functions there. I personally bought the FX 991 ES and it helped so much because it had integrals and you can switch modes where you can calculate binomial, normal, and Poisson (just look at the calculator guide and see how to do it). The project is lenient as long as you follow the rubric.  We picked a topic where it felt like a research paper than anything (we did literature review, methods, results, discussion . Any additional requirements we list it in the annexes). But overall I'd say your main focus for this course is the practice exams and whatever question you can get ahold of using other probability/stats textbooks.
Good think about Dave is that he knows how to teach without reading the script so its more engaging then, lets say ISYE 6501 where Dr Sokol reads off the slides a lot  (no hard feelings to Sokol, but I gotta give aura points to Dave for not reading off the slides). I never really had to look for external resources beyond Module 2 and everything is pretty much self contained as he said.
Its a great class overall, it prepares you for more advanced classes like CDA.

I was surprised at the immense amount of material covered in this class. And, as usual at Georgia Tech, they found an infinite number of ways to generate problems on the material. If you have time, I recommend going over the bootcamp course... It should help you with the first exam, at least. Watching the posted exam review questions were really helpful as well... Although I caught on to those late. I felt comfortable doing the HW problems by myself but, a word of caution, they can bring a set of totally different questions on the exams.

Definitely a well designed course. Dave Goldsman does an amazing job at online instruction.  He is very understandable because he doesn't read off the slides. I highly recommend taking this course early in your OMSA journey as it sets you up for future courses.
I would however, prepare in advance by viewing his ISYE 6739 course a few weeks before the course starts as this is 90%  a Math/Stats course.
Personally speaking, I came in with only a year after taking Calc 2 from a community college and 2 years  from basic statistics. For Calc  2, I'd just focus on learning how to integrate. You'd probably want to review how to do double integrals as well because there is a section in the course that covers joint distributions.
Also, make sure to get a good calculator that does probability distributions. and learn how to use it well.  I used FX 991 ES for the exams and it has done wonders for me.`,rating:5,difficulty:4,workload:16},{user:"+f0pupb29VclcTpEosLxyg==",reviewDate:"July 28, 2024",semester:"summer 2024",review:`Overall recommendation: Highly recommend this class as a gentle introduction to probability theory.
Practical use case of this class: ARENA was the software that is recommended for this class but it only made up 10% of the class (remaining 90% is theoretical, see the bottom for detailed description). You can use Python / other programming languages for the project as well.
Project: The project can be done individually or as a group (max of 4 members). The difficulty of the project scales with more members of the team. I had 3 members in the group, and we did not know about the difficulty scaling. As a result, the project was really difficult. However, post the project, I felt I leveled up in my coding skills in Python.
Lecture content:
First-third: Firehose of refreshers for calculus and probability theory. I did not have any formal classes in probability back in uni so this course helped in teaching me the basics in probability. This section is very heavy on mathematics (but basic calculus, e.g. single-variable differentiation, integration) but geared more towards understanding the various distributions and probability theory. This section is mostly covered for Midterm 1.
Second-third: A refresher of the first-third of the course but more in-depth. This section is mainly just how to generate distributions from scratch and less on simulation. For example, how do you generate a uniform distribution from scratch (without packages) and from the uniform distribution, how do you generate exponential, normal distributions, etc. This covers most of Midterm 2.
Last-third: Now this is where the true fun starts for simulation. This section provides information on how do you know what distributions do you use for your simulation and how do you know your distributions matches the real data. This goes into chi-square distribution for goodness-of-fit testing for input analysis. Then post-simulation, how do you know the confidence interval of your results (e.g. whats is the 95% confidence interval for your mean), it also deep dives into running multiple replications of your simulation and getting the confidence interval of your results. Lastly, how do you compare the simulation from different parameters ran for your simulation (e.g. does 4 servers in a restaurant reduce waiting time vs 3 servers in a restaurant). I felt this section was the most relevant for simulation for me. This forms the bulk of Finals.`,rating:5,difficulty:3,workload:10},{user:"8lbEmMejN1JrEVsQp6Li/Q==",reviewDate:"July 23, 2024",semester:"summer 2023",review:"I loved this class and loved professor Goldsman.

I really appreciate that the lectures are made as easy as possible to follow given the content and that you can tell that Professor Goldsman truly cares about the material he is teaching. My only gripe is that I would have really enjoyed getting more hands on experience with simulation software like Arena or SimPy in the class, as it is primarily focused on the theory and math that supports simulation.

The lectures are fantastic, the instructors are very accommodating, and there is abundant supplemental material to help you succeed. There is nothing negative to say about the course that I can think of, but there may be some reasons you may not want to take it if you are in the OMSCS program, like I am. (I suggest you take this if you are in OMSA, and it may even be required.)
In short, this is a math class. There isn't too much hands-on and there is a lot of material and the tests are tricky if you do not have a solid stats background. I read that this was supposed to be an easier class I could take over the summer - at least the reviews on OMS Central indicate that is true. But I found it a lot more challenging and difficult to study over the summer months. In the end, I think I lacked the statistical and match background to breeze thru this course, and I would have preferred something a little more hands-on. I was considering enrolling in OMSA after completing OMSCS, but if the level of required stats is anything indicative of this course, I think I am going to have to pass. More about the course...
The instructor, Dr. David Goldsman, is very knowledgeable and articulate. His presentations are easy to follow and map very well to the assignments. He is funny and tells lots of subtle jokes. He also looks and sounds much like Larry David, and I kept having "Curb your Enthusiasm" flashbacks. His lectures, for this reason, are fun to listen to and are as enjoyable as high-level statistic lectures can be.  He pokes fun at Justin Bieber and the University of Georgia a lot, but it is all in good fun.
Dr. Goldsman also is quite present on Piazza and involved in the class. More so than most other professors in the OMSA/OMSCS program. He is a hoot and an excellent instructor.
The TAs are also fantastic. Especially the lead instructors are exceptionally knowledgeable and do a great job providing timely answers on Piazza, and their PowerPoints supplement lectures and are helpful for the homework assignments. The TAs, especially the lead TAs, go to great lengths to answer anything on Piazza. They are outstanding.
Pro Tip - every week, the TAs review the upcoming homework assignment. They provide a recorded video lecture and PowerPoint. These are fantastic resources and will help you do well on the homework. A few of the early office hours had TAs that were a little dry, so I didn't attend the early semester office hours but realized halfway through the class that this was a huge mistake.
Most of the course grade comes from 2 exams and a final. Together those three items are 80% of your final grade. The homework assignments are important because they help you study and prepare for the exams. They are due weekly and are not that bad, but some are tougher than others, and they require that you watch the lectures and work through some of the problems. I appreciate that they were due weekly cause it made studying for the exams much easier by forcing me not to fall behind.
The homeworks were worth 10%, and the project was worth another 10%. The project is a group project and, like any other group project, is a cluster. A typical 4-person team consists of one person that does absolutely nothing, one that is moderately useful, one that is an endless stream of bad ideas, and one that is a hero. I was the moderately useful one on my team. Since it was only worth 10%, it was hard to get motivated because the course was fast-paced, and it always felt like there was an exam that you had to prepare for.
The project and software used to do simulations was Arena. It is good, but it felt like an afterthought since so much of the class tests math and stats. Even after finishing this course, I am not confident I could model a medium-complexity simulation with Arena.
Why you may not want to take this course, especially those in OMSCS
This is a math course. If you have a solid statistics background, and by solid, I mean you were a stats or math major as an undergraduate or work as an actuary, then this class will be easy peasy. If you are just ok at stats and math (like me), this class can be challenging and will require you to work. Do you want to take a math course, or do you want to do hands-on projects involving simulation? This class is more of the former; you may prefer the latter, and if so, you should carefully consider taking this course as one of your free electives.
I took this class in the summer, and although I enjoyed the topic, I found it difficult to motivate myself. The schedule was tight because it was summer, and there was little to no downtime. (This will be the last summer course I ever take) Even during weeks when there was an exam or project deadline, you still had homework due. There is even a homework assignment the week of the final. Piazza is really busy, and impossible to keep up with all the posts.
One of my major disappointments was that the simulation focused mainly on 'industrial' or 'resource-based' simulations. Simulations where you have physical resources like a help desk, or a factory assembly line, or elevator, or you get the point. The Arena software by Rockwell is really good at these types of simulations. But I was more interested in Monte Carlo simulations related to finance, stock portfolios, options trading, card games, etc. Many of these can be done with Python or Excel, and Arena is probably not the best tool. The instructor does touch on these topics, and you certainly will have the tools to tackle these types of simulations after the course, but I was hoping for more hands-on simulation work in this area.
In conclusion, this is a fantastic, well-put-together course in which you will learn a lot of math and statistics that will be helpful in many other classes in graduate school and beyond. The instruction is top-notch for an online course, and you have everything you need to be 100% successful. The instructors are very active on Piazza, and there are many opportunities to interact with instructors via Zoom during office hours. The supplemental materials are excellent. I haven't received a grade yet cause the class is still in progress. However, the instructors have hinted that there will be a generous curve, and there have been plenty of bonus and extra credit opportunities along the way. As an elective, be advised it is less hands-on than other courses in the OMSCS program. There is a slight industrial systems engineering focus rather than a financial modeling focus and approach. Either way, this class is great, and I recommend it to anyone interested in the topic.`,rating:4,difficulty:5,workload:15},{user:"fSCmQXFvyfSsoe2WxkpPJA==",reviewDate:"May 11, 2023",semester:"spring 2023",review:`Wow, this course is really challenging! In OMSA, you have to choose between Simulation or Optimization theory, and it's a math course. The class covers a lot of advanced statistical concepts, such as conditional probability, discrete uniform distribution, covariance and correlation, and continuous distributions. You'll also learn about things like inverse transform theorem for continuous random variables, hand simulation, Monte Carlo integration, Arena Simulation, random variate generation, input analysis, output analysis, comparing systems, and more. Each week, new topics were introduced, which was both exciting and daunting (mostly daunting). One important lesson I learned is that, For God's sake it's best to use a commercially available random number generator instead of creating your own.
You will be doing some (1/3) simulation in class. Professor leads you through various simulations utilizing Arena and provide you with tools/use cases to experiment with or expand your knowledge by digging deeper. Professor is always emphasizing right way to simulate using theory.
The best things about this course are Dr. Goldsman and his TAs. Dr. Goldsman is funny, interesting, and respectful towards everyone. He helps students who are struggling with the course material and provides them with the necessary tools to succeed. He gives entertaining talks and has some opinions about Justin Bieber and the University of Georgia. Dr. Goldsman also posts all assignments within the first week of class, which I found helpful. The final grade is based on three tests (80%), thirteen homework assignments (10%), and a project (10%). If you like statistics, you will enjoy this class

But this class wasn't what I expected. I thought we would focus on the different aspect of making a successful simulation... both in setup and in review and analyzing the output. Really that is just Module 9 and Module 10 which were both very in-depth but they felt like they should've been half the class not 20%.
Instead we spent a ton of time on Math and talking about how to generate random numbers and how to turn uniform random numbers into various distributions. And I just don't see myself ever using that in my job. I want to run a warehouse simulation for my company and I can do a very basic one, but I don't think I learned enough about simulation for it to really be that good.

If you possess good calculus and statistics knowledge and ability, this class will likely be of little difficulty for you.  However, if you are like me, i.e. old and forgetful of the calculus you learned 15-20 years ago, there will be a struggle.
A good deal of the material feels theoretical; apart from a few Arena simulations and the course project, I don't feel I learned much in the way of how to apply most of this course to the "real world", which for me is almost the entire reason for going back to school.

Professor Goldsman does a great job to inject levity into subject matter that's otherwise quite dry and unexciting.  The TAs do a good job of running the course as well.

I think the course does a nice job of being both theoretical and practical. Aspiring data scientists should not shy away from the mathematical underpinnings of the things discussed in this course. Do you really want to be someone who just runs functions created by others and hope they work and are mathematically sound? Do you really only want to have a surface level understanding of things and not be able to extend or expand?

Organization is great as others have mentioned below.
I will solely lament over the materials in this class. I won't repeat everything that has been mentioned before (yes, very math intensive and has tons of mathematical concepts about generating random variables, way too many materials and modules). If you are like me and you have a heavy business background, you may have done well in Calculus back you were in high school like 12-15 years ago, you will struggle in this class. I did both AP Calculus AB and BC in high school and did great in both classes, I even used to consider myself pretty good in calculus. But that was 15 years ago. It has been 15 years since I tried to calculate the integral of anything. So yeah if you're like me, you will not just struggle. You will roll your eyes, maybe plunge into multiple panic modes in the semester after seeing ungodly mathematical proofs or concepts that you're struggling to follow. The concepts are built upon each other, so if you don't understand the beginning then you will continue to struggle till the end. If you majored in math or stats, then this class is probably fine for you, or even interesting. I never got to the point of appreciating the topics because I'm just struggling through mathematical equations and concepts 90% of the time.
This is my last and least favorite class in the program.
Added after reading an above comment: Some of y'all need to chill out. No need to be "disgusted" because others are struggling with math while you are not :) Not all analytics professionals are math wizards. Analytics professionals are allowed to be scared of math. Some of us are trying to cross the ocean from one profession to another. Everyone is different. Just because some people struggle in this course, does not mean they will be a terrible analytics professional. Learning lasts a lifetime. If you're discouraged because comments like above, please don't be. Struggle through the class and then move on with your life. Maybe you'll do real life simulations at work and things will start to click for you.

I liked the Arena exam questions. They were an opportunity for basically "free points" on the exam.

My suggestion is to trim the number of submission by half, and perhaps give 1 or 2 exams instead of 3, and increase the number of simulation projects to 2 or 3.



ARENA - an outdated software almost no one uses. Instead, either move to Python or R or just let the students deal with it (and remove the lectures about ARENA or just provide them as optional).

I was personally disappointed in this course and felt I wasted the slot on what could have been a more useful class. While the instructor and TA's were great and Goldsman definitely tried to add in some humor, I felt that much of the material simply won't be that useful for me in my career and that the videos were far too long.

The course shifts from periods of high intensity to periods of extremely low intensity where we review a simulation tool I'm unlikely to ever use (Arena), sort of like a rollercoaster. I found it much more helpful to look up videos online of the topics presented for math concepts than watching the videos presented in the course. I also found the tests to be largely about how good of a cheat sheet you'd created and either memorizing or looking up information and formulas to apply to problems. I'm personally not a fan of this style of work; I'd rather learn how to do and understand something deeply than how to build and read a cheat sheet with tons of obscure formulas and information on it.
Perhaps, if I'd taken the course in a regular semester with more time to really digest the information I would have enjoyed it more, but if I had a second chance to choose, I would pass on this course in favor of another.`,rating:2,difficulty:4,workload:12},{user:"Georgia Tech Student",reviewDate:"August 3, 2021",semester:"summer 2021",review:"I found this course particularly difficult.

How to be successful on this course:

Buy a good graphing calculator. I highly recommend HP Prime if you never had graphing calculator before. If you already have something like TI-Inspire, then you should be fine.
Create a cheat sheet in Google Docs and fill it with formulas and other important information as you go through the course. I highly recommend adding PDF, CDF, Variances, and Means of all distributions that will be covered. Although the course syllabus states that you allowed only handwritten notes, course staff allow you to have printed one.
It is ok if you don't understand math proof of some stuff. Personally, I recommend first try to do knowledge checks and homework reviews. Each question will have a reference to a specific lecture that covers the material. Even though, this method is more involving and counterintuitive it is effective.
Homeworks are released at the beginning of the course. Thus, I recommend doing them bit by bit from day one. I managed to get 80-90% because of that.
There are 2 projects and each is worth 5% of your grade. Make sure that you don't pick a too overwhelming topic and do the project from the day they were released at least 1 hour a day.
Final is a fair game. I would strongly suggest completing Practice tests and also Knowledge Checks and Homeworks by the following technique. Do a practice test, and mark all the questions that you cannot solve. Then do the second iteration of this test, but this time only do those questions that you cannot solve on the previous run. And so on. Until you have nothing to solve. (I.e. Cal Newport method).
On the finals, I strongly recommend focusing first on less involving questions (like questions about Arena).

Please note that this is mainly a math course i.e. during the entire semester I didn't do any programming at all. But I solved a lot of math problems.
Although at some weeks I studied more than 40 hours per week, and never less than 15-20 hours, it was a really good course. I can see how my math skills improved!
Prof. Goldsman knows his subject and teaches it well. TAs are very very responsive. Grading is quite generous as well.

The TAs and instructors are helpful and accessible (but not too helpful!) for every assignment. Goldsmith is a wonderful instructor and his lecture videos flow well. The lecture slides are provided too and mostly capture everything he says (though you may not get to experience all of his humor).
I think what sets this course apart from the others I've taken so far is that, while the content was familiar for me, the assignments and exams still test you thoroughly and encompass the breadth of the content. They make you think about concepts and really get them. To me, CSE 6040 and ISYE 6501 were just shy of doing this but felt too much like a whirlwind tour of concepts, and ISYE 6414 and MGT 6203 introduced plenty of content but didn't seem to test you at a deep enough level. Again, maybe this is because I knew a lot of the Probability and Simulation content before taking this class, but I'm still inclined to think this class has one of the best balances.
Some people felt pressured with the two "mini-projects" we had to do, but I chose the topics that only required a 1-person group and I had so much fun with them. I was able to write up the projects in Python pretty quickly. Goldsmith even describes these topics as relatively straightforward, so he then expects you to explore as much as you can when doing your analysis.
Otherwise, this is a well-paced course and I think it pairs well with another easy course, even in the summer (I took this with Regression).
Assignment Breakdown (remember this is for a summer term):

Quizzes (1% each): 10 weekly assignments, mostly quick (1-3 hours), all MC/TF, more than half with bonus questions.
Mini-Projects (5% each): 2 projects as described above, with 2-3 weeks each to work on and spread out over the semester. Usually an implementation of or research on a particular concept, and a write-up on findings. Expected 15 hours of work and 5 pages per person per group.
Midterms (25% each): 2 midterms that very fairly assess your knowledge of the material. All MC/TF. Cumulative. Practice exams and solutions are given before each exam and plenty of TA office hours. Cheat sheets are allowed.
Final (30%): Similar to the midterms in format, and similar fairness.

There are office hours to help you get through each homework. After those are graded, there are office hours to go over the solutions to help you understand anything you might have missed. There are multiple office hours to prep you for each exam, and then there are office hours to go over those solutions, too. Questions posted to Piazza are often answered in minutes or even seconds. The entire course staff is incredibly engaged and helpful.
You should know (and others have pointed out) that this is very much a math class, and the actual simulation content is a bit lacking. The content in later weeks builds on the content from earlier weeks, so you'll want to make sure you get really confident with all of it as you move through the class or you'll struggle later. That's a challenge sometimes because the content can come at you pretty fast. There's a lot of it.
The exams, particularly the 2nd midterm, can be tough. Personally I'd like to see one or two fewer exams and one or two more projects, because the projects are awesome - they give you a ton of interesting ideas to choose from, and then there's always a "make up your own" option, too.

Advice: Get a good calculator with a strong CAS offering (I used an HP Prime, but higher-end TIs should be just as helpful). They'll tell you that any calculator that can do logs and such will do, and they're not wrong, but that presupposes that at exam time you'll be able to do any arbitrary integral or double integral and a bunch of other manipulations. I wanted an insurance policy so I got a really good calculator that can do all of that stuff itself and I'm glad I did. The calculator rule for us was basically "If it fits in your hand and isn't a phone you can use it."

I really liked this class, but it did deviate from my expectations. This class spends very little time actually simulating anything. There are a few weeks of Arena, but those are more about learning the interface than really modelling.
This class is very math focused, more so than I expected. The first few weeks are all math primers, which is great if you need refreshers on baby statistics, calculus, and linear algebra.
The class was pretty easy up until midterm 2, which can set you up for trouble. After midterm 1 the class starts piling on concepts, subtle definitions, and more complicated ideas. midterm 2 was quite difficult, and there is only a couple weeks until the final. The last few weeks of the course are very intense.

There are two projects throughout the semester that are fun and have strong applications of what you learn in the class. I picked projects that make me practice my Python coding.
Exams are extensive and cover pretty much everything in the course. Go over the slides and make your equation sheets based on them. Do the practice exams and use Piazza as a resource for any questions you may have.

Those with a strong statistics background will get some value out of connecting the theory with the process of simulation. But those who reached their statistical pinnacle when playing Dungeons and Dragons while listening to Justin Bieber (like me) will find themselves drowning in an ocean of abstract trivia.
Everything said about the engagement of the professor and the dedication of the TA's is true. But the whole teaching staff seem to be suffering from the same, old-fashioned delusion: that the best way to explain a concept to a student is to hit them with a proof. I don't need the proof - I never doubted you. What I need is the intuition.
The fact that there are no intuition-building stories in this course seems like a huge missed opportunity. Tell me about the time an airplane fell out of the sky because they used single-stage sampling instead of two-stage sampling. Tell me about the bridge that collapsed because they used an exponential distribution instead of a gamma distribution. Tell me how they averted disaster by switching from a Normal distribution to a Weibull. The only justification we get for selecting a 90% confidence interval instead of any other is "because the boss wants it". Perhaps they teach what bosses need to know at UGA?
Simulation is used when the phenomenon is too complicated for a formula. It is therefore ironic that a course on simulation is taught as if there is an abstract mathematical solution to every problem. At one point the professor says "in the real world this would be done with a triangle distribution" and then goes on to prove how a Cauchy distribution can be derived from a Student's t.
The world of simulation also covers a lot more than just Arena modeling a queue in a factory. But even modeling factory lines is only superficially covered. Factory managers usually have multiple goals they are trying to optimize (not just one). And factory managers worry about improvements that only shift bottlenecks. I am still in no position to help with either problem.
Most of my classmates lavish praise on the course teaching style. That seems baffling. I personally didn't feel motivated to dance in the streets after getting hit with an exam question on Erlang distributions (when the word 'Erlang' was used once in passing at the bottom of a slide). I knew that statistics was a prerequisite, but I thought that meant they wouldn't test you again on the same material. Unfortunately, the vast majority of exam and homework questions don't even pretend to have anything to do with simulation.
For me, the statistics was twice as hard as the simulation. Which is why I needed to put in 30 hours a week instead of just the expected 10 hours. Did I want to learn statistics? Absolutely not. Am I better for it? Definitely.

The course is very heavy on the math, including detailed proofs in the lectures (although not on the homeworks or exams), and light on the applications. This balance was disappointing as I find the applications to be much more interesting than the foundational statistics and math (which can be learned along the way). There are some brief sections on Arena, a simulation language, but it mostly consists of looking at pre-built models or constructing extremely simple models and looking at the output values.
The lectures videos tend to be longer than in other classes (at least those I've taken) at 10-15 minutes and there were around 6-12 videos to watch each week (1.5x speed really helps). There was a homework assignment every week that matched up well with the lectures, no required reading (all the material is covered in the lecture slides), three exams, and a project. The exams and homeworks matched the lectures well and were fair although as with the lectures, they mainly covered the theory and math behind simulations and not the applications.
The project could be completed in small groups, or individually and was really what you make it. The grading was extremely lenient, and the amount of effort you put in and how much you learned was entirely dependent on your own motivation. I did a programming project and enjoyed doing the research and writing the code to implement a theoretical topic covered in lectures. It was the most rewarding part of the class to me, and if you really are concerned with learning something, I'd suggest picking a challenging project and forcing yourself to understand and implement the concept.
Overall, this course is relatively easy and low-effort and the Professor (David Goldsman) clearly loves teaching. His enthusiasm for the course makes it easier to get through the sometimes tedious lectures although the course would be improved if it focused more on applications and less on the mathematics and statistics basics.

As someone whose ability to do basic mathematical thinking steadily atrophies without exercise, it was a great way to stay sharp without burning up too much free time. Once the math/stats bootcamp modules finished up, I probably put in 2-3 hours of work per week, which was enough to finish at the low end of an A grade (~87%, thanks to a very friendly curve). The Arena software is really annoying, especially if you're on on a Windows PC, but I only opened it once all quarter - you might miss a quiz point or two here and there, but you could probably go the entire semester without ever using it. In an ideal world, the course would use a different software platform for running simulations, but I wouldn't get my hopes up if I were a future student.
Fall 2020 introduced a new project requirement, which can either be done in (self-selected) groups or alone. Goldsman provides 20 or so possible topics, some suggested for groups and others for individuals (though you ultimately could choose to do any topic that you wanted). I bit off a bit more than I could chew and wound up putting ~20 hours in, which was a little disproportionate to what it was worth (5% total). It was a valuable experience, though, and made it so I didn't need to study for a large portion of the final, as it tied directly into course content.
Overall, I greatly enjoyed the course. As an OMSCS student in the ML track, it's a great way to stay fresh on the math-y side without burning out. Interested students should consider reviewing Goldsman's undergrad probability/stats class, the lectures for which are available somewhere on the GT website (Kaltura maybe?), if you're at all nervous about your math background, but I think most people in the program would be able to keep up even if they never took a calc-based stats class in college.`,rating:5,difficulty:2,workload:5},{user:"Georgia Tech Student",reviewDate:"December 11, 2020",semester:"fall 2020",review:`Took this as one of my first courses along with 3 others.

If you're at all interested in simulation or just looking for an interesting elective that isn't a mountain of work, this is worth taking.
Best advice I can give is to be very thorough making your cheat sheets for the exams. I just took the final and twice came to a question and thought, dang, I don't remember whatever small esoteric fact I needed to solve the question.

Much of the workload in this class is done prior to the class itself. Make sure you satisfy the Stats and Probability pre-reqs. A good pre-reading would be Professor Goldsman's open set of Probability and Statistics EdX classes (https://www.edx.org/bio/david-goldsman, or Google ISYE 6739).
The A's are historically cut-off high (not that 90 high, but pretty close), and not without surprise -> if you understand his pre-req stuff really well, an A is a shoo-in, even for me without an Undergrad background. Just be proactive and serious about learning - the TAs are the best bunch - shout out to Mariana, Michael Kuehn (of the Bayesian fame) and James Roberts, amongst a list of others.
Otherwise, a B is the default. Goldsman's curve is huge. Heck even a 60+ is a B. Just make sure you can demonstrate to the Prof that you know how to compute something legible. That being said, he increasingly does give Cs and Ds - but anecdotal evidences suggest that there are alot of students who come in without the pre-reqs and he has to use this as an only way if you really not deserve a B (like, for example, not knowing how to compute sample variance).
The test difficulty varies by semester. In some semesters it feels like Test 3 > 2 > 1. For me in this semester, 2 was the hardest (75 average), then 1, then 3. I suggest to treat such opinions as a pinch of salt, but do follow the advices of the TAs closely - they do give obvious test nuggets in Piazza if you search well for it. At the end of the day, you get the grade you deserve. Tests are a good indicator and no tricky stuff unlike Sokol's - either you know or you don't (sans carelessness).
It is possible to get 3 perfect test scores (yep, without bonuses). For this semester, I can now confirm it's the Red Panda (go ask around who s/he is). Go ask around to see who s/he is!
There is alot of social cohesion in this class, with the student community easily available on the Slack channels. Even the TA (and even the Prof!) themselves appear there. Prof Goldsman himself embraces the memes and Slack emojis that were made for him - which is now the default fun emoji to use throughout the OMSA Slack at omsa-study.slack.com.
Take your cheatsheet, seriously. You're given practice questions. Copy them to your cheatsheet. That could be a fine difference between an A or a B 😂

Tip: For each midterm you get a cheat sheet (2 pages for first, 4 for second, 6 for final). Work on your cheat sheet with every assignment!

You really need to know statistics and distributions in this course. I have been fuzzy on them and it hurt.


The exams (which is 90%) of your grade, feels a bit like trivia to me. Like if you didn't write down on your cheat sheet some bit of information and you don't remember it yourself. You will not be able to answer some questions. While this makes for a good exam that you have to study for. I question whether this is really testing my understanding of simulation and how to run one effectively. It feels like it's testing my understanding of the maths / tools much more than my understanding of what a simulation is.
In fact, I would carefully venture out and say that the exams really don't test your understanding of how to setup a good simulation or run one. They really test your understanding of the maths that simulations depend on.
Overall this would be my biggest feedback for the course, you will learn the math that supports all simulations. You will learn proofs of correctness for ways to choose the best performing simulation. But you will get very little practice in actually setting up simulations.
I would have liked to have a practical examples, where we had to setup simulations and analyze them. We didn't really do that at all. We went through some demos that were given to us, but we never had to actually do the work ourselves.  Then we spent a lot of time on the math.

Easy to get a B, tough to get an A.

PRO's:
Great teacher. Knows the topics well and most importantly, knows how to TEACH the topic well. All the OMSA professors I've had so far know the topics they teach very well, no doubt. But the ability to see the subject from the point of view of a student who is learning it for the first time, or has been away from the classroom for a while, is a real gift. What I mean is that Prof Goldsman knows which concepts can be confusing to a newbie, which need to be stressed over and over, and which ones are good to know, but you can get by without burning in your brain. And he points all of those out.
Great TA's. THE BEST TA's I've had so far in OMSA. Just like the professor, they know the topic well and are able to explain it well. Very responsive on Piazza too.
Lively lectures. Prof Goldsman's videos are definitely not boring.
Very good layout of topics. I loved the way the topics were structured. You start out with a Calculus and Statistics bootcamp, which was perfect for me, since it's been 20+ years since I touched this stuff. By the time we got to later Mathy topics, I felt very ready and confident of my understanding of the topics. Some reviewers complained about not spending enough time working in Arena. I do agree with this to an extent, in that it would be nice to have done more full, real-word simulations. But I feel like this class gives you the important tools you need, and specializing in Arena or other simulation tools is something you can do later on your own.
Very considerate grading. This is just the cherry on top. I would love this class even without it.

The homeworks were fairly challenging, but generally answerable with careful review of lecuture material. The exams were very challenging, even with the cheat sheets we were allowed to create and use. WIth that said, Prof Goldsman offered a generous curve.
As other reviews have mentioned, the class does not spend much time at all on creating or applying simulations. It is very much focused on the theory behind them. I still enjoyed the class and thought it was valuable.

It is VERY math and stats heavy, despite the name.  Some actual simulation is done with Arena, but a vast majority of the course focuses on mathematical and statistical topics.  It is an ANALYSIS of simulation course.  2.  The course starts with "bootcamps" in calculus, probability and statistics.  These are not easy bootcamps.  Some prior knowledge is required, and the topics (with the exception of infinite series stuff) is used throughout the course.  3.  The course consists (when I took it) of 10% homework (due weekly) and three exams all weighted at 30%.
Homework:  Pretty easy, actually.
Exam 1:  Hard
Exam 2: A Little Less Hard
Exam 3: Super Hard
I aced 6040, 6501 and Business Fundamentals (8803)... or if not "aced", I did get an "A" in all of them.  Grades have not been posted for this class yet, but I suspect I will get a B in Simulation.  I am an older student, and it has been a LONG time since I have done any calculus, stats or probability.  (Before taking this class, I had never heard of an Erlang distribution and thought Brownian Motion was exclusively some kind of physics thing.)  This course was a great refresher for that stuff and much more.  Again, I will state that this is a difficult class.
Don't let the above scare you too much, though. This was really a fantastic course.  Dr. Goldsman is an outstanding professor and the lead TA was the best that I have had so far.  The videos are engaging and funny...  and relatively free of any errors.  (Something that cannot be said for other classes.)  If you're looking for an easy class and grade, then skip this one (thought I do hear that he curves the grades, and the statistics on https://critique.gatech.edu/course.php?id=ISYE6644 do reflect that).

I agree with all of that, but I don't agree that this is the greatest course ever. It was okay, but I feel disappointed coming in with such lofty expectations.
First: this class isn't actually about simulations. It covers the programming language/software Arena a little bit but not enough that you can go out and make your own simulations. Instead, the class is mostly about the math behind randomness. Which there's nothing wrong with, of course, but it's not the topic I thought we'd cover.
Second: A lot of the questions on midterms and homeworks are barely covered in the lectures. Some other courses - Bayesian, Regression, etc. - have the reputations that you need to do outside research to learn how to do certain things. I never thought this would be one of them, but lo and behold. For instance, I searched around lecture notes for hours and never found an explanation of what an Erlang distribution was, I had to find it somewhere else. Some of the exam questions - now that I'm done with it - I still don't understand where the answers came from. This isn't a complaint due to my grade - the curve is extremely lenient - but I wish I'd have understood more of it, walking out.

Good:


Goldsman, is a hilarious teacher who builds some legitimately laugh out loud moments in his lectures


There is a lot of solid content on statistics, calculus, and just a tiny bit of linear algebra that offers a review of concepts I have not seen in the 5 previous courses I have taken


Improve:


I wouldn't call this a practical simulation class as much as fusion of statistics and a tour of what simulation is capable of . I think I learned some interesting concepts but I would have a more solid understanding of graduate statistics if Goldsman separated that into its own course.  Then he could have a course in simulation with graduate stats as a prereq that would dive into far more detail in actually writing simulations. Having said that, Goldsman claims making simulations are easy if you understand the underlying math so maybe there really is a method to his madness.


Another unpopular opinion here: Make the homeworks harder. I love some of the freebie questions, but I'd content that really tests a student's understanding right from the beginning


More good:


TAs were all stars. Mariana knows her stuff and will stay on for hours explaining concepts to students. All TAs also gave prompt and not condescending feedback.


I thought the cadence of having weekly homeworks kept the concepts fairly fresh as we learned them and the fact that they were all made available completely at the beginning of the course mean that people with mid semester time committments could plan effectively.


Optional content. I love that there are a bunch of videos that we aren't expected to know since the professor wants to keep this course self-contained. It's a great way to keep the course accessible to anyone who's taken a calc and/or stats course while letting those who want more dive in deeply

I realized halfway through the class that what I was learning would not be particularly useful for my job. So I kinda phoned it in and only watched the lectures for entertainment value and did enough of the homework a 90 and studied maybe 2 hours for each exam.
I got a B on the midterm 2 after studying for 1 hour, then got super super sick the last 3 weeks of the class and decided to put in even less effort. My choice of not studying backfired hard on me. I ended up getting a D on the final, but thankfully the professor seems to be super generous and curves a D+ to a B.

The main benefit of this class is teaching me that I am not cut out to learn advanced or even intermediate statistics. Even with a professor as entertaining as Dr. Goldman, I could not stay motivated to even memorize my basic stats distributions.
Thankfully you can now be an applied data scientist who only moves data around and pumps it through the latest ML packages without understanding any of the underlying math. So hoping I can continue collecting my nice paycheck while not actually knowing statistics.

The first third of the HWs (e.g. during the calc/prob/stats review) are more challenging; 2nd third are easier, and the final third are easiest.  I experienced the exams trending the opposite way.  Practice exams are provided, and are helpful; A is curved to high-80s and B is very generously curved (to something in the 60s).

Need to say again that the TAs, and even Prof. Goldsman, are extraordinarily active/responsive on piazza, with adding extra office hours, even offering individual help.  It's truly remarkable.  Such a great experience.
My only critical feedback would be that I occasionally wanted Prof. Goldsman to be a little more technical/detailed in his presentation (e.g. when he described convolution in Lecture 7.6 as "basically adding things up"; like, please say more than that!).

Even though the course is said to be self-contained, I disagree a little with this statement.

Only single variate calculus is covered in this course, but you need to understand partial derivatives for the Maximum Likelihood Estimator's lecture, for instance.
Other than that, you need to be comfortable with probabilities and stats. Those topics are covered in the course, but you might feel a need to have a good grasp on them before starting the semester. Thankfully, prof Goldsman provides a free undergraduate course online:

Good:

Professor Goldsman is hilarious. I actually LOL'ed at several points during the videos
You go through a calculus and probability bootcamp at the start of the course, so if you were a little light on your pre-reqs coming in, you get a refresher (NOTE: Do yourself a favor and brush up on these topics before you take this course!!)
Lecture videos are long, but generally the prof keeps things interesting
Workload isn't too bad, but requires some cramming before each test (I suppose like any other course).
TA support is good

Bad:

My big issue with the course is that I feel like I learned a bunch of math without any idea of the applications. We only spent one week going through Arena, and this was basically just a tutorial to get you familiar with the tool. I still have 3 weeks left in the class, but I don't really see us ever using Arena again - hopefully I'm wrong!
To expand on the above, most of the lecture videos were going through complex proofs of different mathmatical techniques and formulas. I can understand needing these if I was an undergrad engineering student, but as someone in the workforce, I feel like the content needed to be much more applied. I think a better approach would be to take more of a case study approach to each module - starting with a simple simulation to highlight how to generate basic uniform RVs, and then moving on to more advanced simulations to highlight advanced concepts. I'm planning on including this feedback in my GTech course review as well.

So, overall, I feel like I'll leave the course more comfortable with how to do double integrals and plug numbers into different probability density functions to get random variables, but if someone asked me "hey, run a simulation on how this factory works!", I'd be lost.`,rating:3,difficulty:3,workload:10},{user:"Georgia Tech Student",reviewDate:"August 8, 2018",semester:"summer 2018",review:`Overall, a pretty effective course in the basis of simulation. However, note that the basis provided is for math; a lot of the material goes towards helping the student understand what goes on under the hood so there is quite a bit of probability, statistics, and calculus in the course. Overall, maybe 80% has to do with the math and about 20% is actually using simulation and the simulation language. There will be demonstrations and case studies, but those will be more for self-enrichment as the exams cover the math and simulation concepts.
Grade breakdown came to 3 exams (30% each), one cheat sheet for exam 1, two cheat sheets for exam 2, and three cheat sheets for exam 3. Exams were very reasonable and most of the exams had high B/low A average for a class of 50 or so in SU2018. Last 10% is homework.
Professor is an interesting and animated guy who keeps his long lectures interesting (compared to management who keeps their long lectures boring). Lecture material goes into a lot more proofs than most people would be comfortable with, and whether it contributes to learning...your mileage may vary. Second pass at development could probably benefit from cutting down on proofs and shifting the bandwidth towards a solo or group project to simulate some real-world process. Otherwise, lots was learned in this class and is worth taking - would like to see a part two of this class for the above.`,rating:4,difficulty:3,workload:5},{user:"Georgia Tech Student",reviewDate:"August 7, 2018",semester:"summer 2018",review:"This course covers both theoretical and practical aspects of simulations. Theory part is mainly on probability, and its level is on undergraduate senior level if you follow closely. The practical part is on case studies about using Arena for simulation. I can see Arena is very useful in modelling simulations. The only part I am not happy with the course is that it does not have large projects using Arena. The best part of the course is Prof. David Goldsman. Absolutely amazing!",rating:5,difficulty:3,workload:6},{user:"Georgia Tech Student",reviewDate:"August 6, 2018",semester:"summer 2018",review:`Course materials are top notch, I enjoyed so much watching lectures and trying out Arena software to model simulation like call center etc. Homework are well thought to prepare students for tests.  This course is heavy in math, embrace it you will come out of this course knowing tons of probability, random variables, and other statistics things.
In short, its an excellent course, it makes me start seeing problems around me that can be simulated and what kind of distribution the data should be drawn from.
For Mac User, you have to install Windows as Arena is only available in Windows, but its not an issue at all, as free VM like Virtualbox are readily available.`,rating:5,difficulty:4,workload:10},{user:"Georgia Tech Student",reviewDate:"July 29, 2018",semester:"summer 2018",review:`First thing to say about this class is that the professor, Dave Goldsman, is probably one of the nicest, fairest and most likable teachers one could ask for. His good-natured UGA jokes kept things light. He was ridiculously accommodating to extra time requests when some of my classmates couldn't take their tests by the deadline. If all this isn't enough, he even referred to himself as Dave "generous curve" Goldsman.
He really wants you to learn the material at the level that is most suitable for YOU. If you are a math nerd and want to get jiggy with it on proofs and derivations, there will be plenty of that. On the other hand, if, like me, you find that stuff a bit much, and prefer to get a high level understanding of things and plug and chug the formulae, you can still at least succeed in the course with the requisite grade. The course works on different levels.
You will have 3 proctor trak'd tests. They were usually about 30-35 questions in 2 hours. You are allowed one cheat sheet for MT1, 2 cheat sheets for MT2, and 3 for the final. Interestingly, my cheat sheets weren't necessarily that helpful in that one can often figure out the correct answer by simply understanding the principles involved. Or in the cases where I got something wrong, my cheat sheet wouldn't have helped anyway.
Workload wasn't too bad. I took it in the summer and could watch the videos and do the homework in probably 5 hours per week. It's the preparation for the exams where I spent most of my time. Those weeks I could easily spend 10 or more hours reviewing and creating my cheat sheets. It's funny, but in a way, the creation of the cheat sheets is when you really learn the material best as it's now the 4th time you're going over it (lecture > knowledge check > homework > cheat sheet), but at a different pace.
As for the subject matter, it mostly follows the book, "Simulation Modeling and Analysis." Like most OMSA courses, you don't need to buy the book, but I picked up an old edition on Amazon for, like, 20 bucks. Figure it's good to have on the shelf. I particularly liked the parts on random variate generation and will find that topic more useful, I think, than any other. My only complaint (and this is similar to optimization, from what I hear) is that the material is very theoretical, rigorous and mathy while providing few if any opportunities for actually building a simulation. Perhaps that is another course, I don't know. One thing is for sure, though, you will come out of this class with a solid understanding of the considerations involved in conducting a simulation study. The experience in actually building one, however, will come with practice later.`,rating:4,difficulty:3,workload:10}],reviewSummaries:{"summer 2024":"The course is well-structured and offers comprehensive content, particularly in probability and statistics, making it a solid foundation for advanced studies.
