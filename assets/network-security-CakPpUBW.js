The documentation of the projects is terrible. You will spend more time alt-tabbing between the multiple docs they provide, none of which they created and are instead pulled from other universities like Stanford.
This course is literally a compilation of other people's work, sloppily put together by non-English speaking TAs. And you can expect the same level of "support" when going through the projects. There is nothing to gain from this course, only useless busy work that is far less engaging than Intro to Sec.
To be honest, this course really has me thinking about the quality of education I am receiving from GA Tech and whether or not it is worth it. It is clear that almost no effort went into preparing this course and it has me worried about other courses.
This is my 4th class (maybe last) and I have straight A's. This program may be an entire waste of time, and the only reason I did it is to show people a piece of paper with the word "Master" on it.

No way, not possible for me.  I worked on it for days and days and days, way more than 1.5 weeks, sometimes getting like 2 hrs of sleep.  Still got a 37/100 on the final project.

I found the topic to be interesting, and definitely came away having learned some critical skills in terms of understanding and being able to pursue network security. The projects are heavily weighted in this class (80% of your grade), and the quizzes are very easy, so long as you have watched/read the lectures.  So long as you do well in those 2 segments, you'll be well on your way to an A, or high B, in the class.
I found the projects to be the absolute best part of this class.  I would say the average amount of time I spent on each was probably in 10-12 hour ballpark, but with the caveat that one project took me as little as 6 hours, and another probably was closer to 20-30 (Final project is ML, and if you don't have any ML experience, it can be difficult, so be prepared to use the time you have been given).
HOWEVER, with that being said, I have some serious critiques of the course.


The lectures are interesting, but I would say, rather short, and don't do a great job explaining the material.  I learned a great deal more in this class reading the provided white papers than I did from the lecture, personally.  The lectures do a good job setting up the content of the papers, but to really understand the content, I'd say be prepared to read them.  (To be clear, this is not necessary to be successful in the class, but if you want to walk away with a good understanding of the material, I'd say take the time to read them.)


The projects, as fun/interesting as they are, are not well defined.  By this I mean: the projects tend to simply thrust you into the topic/task, without providing a lot of context as to why you are doing them.  I found this to be pretty disappointing.  Part of the reason you take a course like Network Security is to understand the intent behind the projects.  What/how can I use the skills I've gotten from this project to better my own, personal, career and skill set?  That isn't really well defined in at least 3/5 of the projects, particularly the final project. Even though I received a 100 on it, in the end, I can't tell you how I'd actually apply the skills I received in doing it outside of that very particular project. It was more "leetcode" than "gain knowledge."


There were a fair amount of technical bugs in the course, particularly in regards to the sharing of said White Papers in each module.  Some were simply unavailable on the websites we were directed to in order to download them, and others were effectively behind paywalls that GA Tech students couldn't access.  I was able to find every paper (except for one) with some Google sleuthing, but it's unfortunate I had to do extra work just to read what I was supposed to.


Overall, the course is definitely interesting if you want to learn more about Network Security.  I really couldn't recommend it, otherwise.  Even then, I'd say you'll walk away with a basic understanding of the topic, not what I'd personally consider a "Masters-level" understanding.`,rating:3,difficulty:2,workload:8},{user:"aPUo+fai3Uca5eV1JXAiNw==",reviewDate:"May 11, 2023",semester:"spring 2023",review:"This class was great, I enjoyed most of the projects.

The quizzes are really easy, and sometimes the questions are word-for-word from the lectures or papers. Just watch through lectures at 1.5x, read the papers, and the quizzes should be pretty straightforward. I even missed a few, and it didn't really affect my grade overall.
The exam covered most of the lectures and had a couple questions about the projects -- I spent maybe a couple hours going over some of the lectures I missed, then ended up just winging it and got an 80%. Based on my grades thus far, plus the fact that it was only worth 10% of my grade, it didn't really make sense to spend days reviewing all of the lectures, but YMMV here.
As I mentioned before, the bulk of the class is the projects.

I wouldn't recommend this unless you're confident in your coding/debugging/general technical skills, but for the last couple of projects I started on the Saturday before it was due (it was due Sunday evening) and was able to complete them in ~8 hours or so. If you don't have a technical background, I would start them right when they come out to make sure you have ample time to ask questions.
There was also 5% extra credit where you just gave feedback/suggestions about each project, so definitely do this, as it made the difference between needing an 80% and a 10% on the final to keep my A.

This review isn't overly dissimilar to the one posted on May 3. But I will try to point out a few of the things I feel are important to know about this class.
Class overview
This was my second class in OMSCS. I took CS6035, Introduction to Information Security the previous semester. If you have some background in cybersecurity then you can likely succeed in CS6262 without taking CS6035. There is some overlap between CS6262 and CS6035, but not a huge amount. For me though I am glad I took CS6035 first.
Time Commitment
I did not record my time properly for this class. On weeks where there was a 6 papers to read, a quiz to complete, and a project to work on I was spending around 15-20 hours. On other weeks where all I had to do was skim through 2 or 3 papers, a quiz and I had already finished the project it was more like 5 hours. The time I have given on OMSCentral is a best guess estimate at the average input per week.
Project 1
Project 1 was a lot of fun. I had no previous experience in penetration testing so getting to use tools like Metasploit was enjoyable. If you have a basic understanding of Linux and can follow the instructions in the writeup, which are designed to guide you to success, there's no reason why you shouldn't do well on this priject.
Project 2
Project 2 was probably my favourite as it focused on malware analysis and forced us to go deeper by using reverse engineering and debugging tools. The fact that you have to analyse Windows, Linux and Android malware samples means that you get to try a wider range of tools and techniques. Again the writeup does a lot to guide you on what to do to succeed. This makes sense as malware analysis is difficult and for many this will be their introduction to the process and without guidance I would expect a lot of students getting stuck on this project early on.
Project 3
Project 3 seemed to be the one that a lot of students had the most difficulty with and this is probably because it required some Javascript coding. The project is about launching web attacks against a blog writing website. The environment created for the project feels a bit odd at first because you have to deliver results to a per-student page using requests. Once you get over the hurdle of how to do this properly things get easier. There was also a bit of confusion as the project writeup recommended to launch one of the attacks in one way, but then the project TA recommended on Piazza (or maybe it was in the Bluejeans demo video) to do it another way. This highlights an important point: Read Piazza! (More on that down below). Overall I think this project seems more difficult than it really is, but for anyone who is weak with Javascript I would recommend spending a little time to understand promises to make your life easier.
Project 4
This was probably my least favourite project, and it wasn't that bad. Project 4 was about analysing traffic in Wireshark and then writing Snort rules to detect certain types of attacks. The reason why I didn't like this project was that I felt there was some misdirection in the project writeup on what we were supposed to look for in DDoS traffic. This led me to waste a lot of time going down the wrong path trying to find the solution. I also burned a lot of Gradescope submissions doing this, and submissions were limited to 10 for this project to prevent bruteforcing the solution. To counter this though one of the project TAs, Melissa, went out of her way to help get me back on track with this project. She deserves a medal for dealing with my stream of annoying questions, and for answering some of those questions live during Office Hours (of which I only attended 1 for the semester).
Project 5
This project was about machine learning for intrusion detection and evading an IDS by modifying an attack payload to bypass the IDS. This was a fun project and involved some Python programming. I liked this project because it provided less guidance than the others. It required us to read and understand concepts from a paper and apply them as an algorithm in Python code. To be fair, the most important parts of the paper were distilled into a simpler form in the project writeup, but you still needed to read the paper to understand the different terms required in the algorithm. There was a project in CS6035 that focused on machine learning, but unlike that project, this one really did not require more than the most minimal understanding of what machine learning is. There were parameters for a machine learning model to tune, but unlike in CS6035 they were far better explained, and tuning the model was quite easy and for me there was no frustration over trying to understand how the machine learning model worked which wasn't part of the project anyway. This was a good project to end the semester on.
Papers
The papers were the low point of this class for me. Some of them were interesting, some of them had some historical significance, others were too mired in technical detail for me to get much out of them. Early on in the semester I looked up advice on how to read academic papers and this genuinely transformed how I read the papers and saved me a lot of time. I would recommend this to other students like me who haven't been exposed to a lot of academic papers before this class. I do recommend reading the papers because the quizzes and exam have questions that relate back to them, but don't get caught up in trying to understand every little detail. Only project 5 required reading any papers to understand the project, and even then the more difficult parts of the paper were distilled into a much more usable form in the project writeup, which was hugely appreciated.
Exam
The final exam was 25 questions with a mixture of multiple choice and true/false type questions. The exam is only worth 10% and the effort required to do well in it is low. To prepare for the exam I re-watched the lecture videos that mapped to the topics given in the exam study guide and re-read the assignment writeups. The topics given only covered just over half of the lectures and the remaining topics were related to the projects. I don't regret having spent the time on preparing, but so long as you did well on the quizzes and projects you could walk into the exam and expect to get a decent grade just from your overall understanding of the semester. I only needed around 2% to ensure an A in the class and got 90% in 15 minutes of the allocated hour.
Extra Credit Assignments
The extra credit assignments were 2 separate reviews of projects 1-3 and 4-5. The reviews aren't particularly good because there isn't consistency in the questions asked. They come out at the end of semester which I felt was not a good idea because by that time a lot of the finer details around each project have been forgotten. I would have preferred a review for each project released alongside each project so that I could give feedback as I worked through the projects. I'm not sure how these assignments are graded but they add up to 5% and I am fairly sure that as long as constructive feedback is provided that full marks are given. These assignments are a good way to get you over the line if you are just shy of a better letter grade.
Piazza & TAs
The Piazza discussion forum was active throughout the semester. The TAs were very helpful in answering questions and providing hints to help with the projects. A lot of good information came up in the discussions on Piazza, but other than one or two instances I did not find crucial information buried in Piazza that should have been in the project writeups. Compared to CS6035 I did not feel that the discussion was stifled by the threat of the OSI hammer. TAs and students were more free to provide helpful information rather than constantly trying not to cross a line by providing too detailed of an answer.
Final Result
At the time of writing the final grades haven't been released and the extra credit assignments haven't been graded but I am sitting on 98.7%.
Final Impressions
I enjoyed Network Security. It gave a good overview of a lot of topics and reinforced the fact that I want to take Advanced Malware Analysis and Information Security Lab. I actually found this class easier than its natural precursor, Introduction to Information Security. I think this was in part because this was my second class so I better understood how things work in OMSCS. I also think that the projects were a little more guided, and to some degree built on the concepts introduced in CS6035. I don't remember anything akin to the slog of trying to figure out XSS, CSRF and SQLi in the web attacks project in CS6035. I would recommend this class, and knowing what I know now, I think it could be paired with another class for those looking to get through OMSCS faster.`,rating:5,difficulty:3,workload:14},{user:"Georgia Tech Student",reviewDate:"May 3, 2022",semester:"spring 2022",review:`Network Security OMSCentral Review
Summary
What this class is
This class is a good introduction to network security topics. It also covers a wide range of adjacent academic papers and their theoretical implementations. This class is mainly project based with quizzes and the final exam a small weight of it. Some of the concepts require solid computer network fundamentals and some exposure to security concepts. This class required mild programming in python and JavaScript. The class utilizes Gradescope for all project except project 5, so you know how you are doing as you complete them.
What this class is NOT
This class doesn’t go extremely in depth on topics in the lectures. The depth of the class can occur on topics relating to the projects. This class will not teach you the basics of networking, such as the OSI model and various protocols. That is prior knowledge that is essential to the class.
My Review (Overall Grade: 97%)
Background
Undergrad CS-major with prior experience in cybersecurity/computer networks. I have probably a little too much background for this class. Therefore, take my below time-spent statistics with a grain of salt.
Overview
Here is a link to the syllabus: https://omscs.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/documents/course_page_docs/syllabi/cs_6262_syllabus_and_schedule_2022-1.pdf
I meticulously tracked my time spent on this course and each individual project throughout the semester using a tracking app. The times stated are very accurate (+/- 5%).
Total Hours spent on this course: 63 hours and 32 minutes
Average hours per week: 3 hours and 44 minutes
Max hours spent in a week: ~9 hours (project 4, Snort/Network monitoring and project 3, web based attacks, took up the most time)
Min hours spent in a week: 0 hours
Lectures/Readings
The video lectures are quick and bite-sized chunks relating to the overall topics and sometimes the associated readings. They are easy to get through. The papers associated can be long. I recommend skimming them unless they directly relate to the project (such as the paper on PAYL for project 5). I did not study the lectures/readings very much.
Quizzes
Quizzes are open book, and weighted very low. I would just take them after looking at the lectures and they will be very easy.
Project 1 (4 hours 50 minutes, Grade: 100%)
This project was a good introduction to penetration testing. You fulfill most of the steps of a penetration test such as scanning, enumerating, to escalating privileges and even cracking password hashes. I have prior experience in penetration testing so this was fun and easy. The escalating privilege aspect of the project can be tough without prior experience.
Project 2 (9 hours 6 minutes, Grade: 98%)
Malware analysis. This project touched on some relevant techniques for malware analysis. However, the malware was very old. This project spanned using tools/techniques to analyze various samples of Linux and Windows malware. I had no prior experience in this and found it challenging but doable as long as you start early and read the writeup thoroughly.
Project 3 (14 hours 22 minutes, Grade 100%)
This project took the most time. It is very JavaScript heavy, with things such as Fetch() and Promise() comprising the most important concepts I wish I knew going into it. With zero JavaScript experience, this took me a lot of time of trial and error to get everything correct. However, I did eventually get it and got full points, so don’t get discouraged just keep plugging away. Review Mozilla Web Dev docs to get an idea of the basic concepts necessary.
Project 4 (13 hours 58 minutes, Grade 100%)
This project uses Snort rules and Wireshark to detect types of network attacks. It is an enlightening project that requires some understanding of Wireshark and network protocols to be efficient. Never used Wireshark before? This may be a tough project. Also, there are snort multithreading issues on the VMs given to the students. I spent a long time debugging an actually correct answer because a snort problem said my rule wasn’t working properly. In short, if it’s not working the way you expect, ask a TA in a private post on Piazza. They were helpful.
Project 5 (6 hours 57 minutes, Grade 100%)
This was by far the most rewarding project. It required reading a paper the professor authored on evading PAYL, which is an ML-based network intrusion detection system. In this project YOU are the attacker. In this project you write python code to implement the algorithms and designs from the paper in order to evade the PAYL by “blending” your network attack to look like normal traffic. This was rewarding as it takes an in-depth understanding of the paper, and recreating the results of it. There is no Gradescope for this project, but you can check your end result with a supplied makefile.

Good cross between security and networking (obviously).`,rating:4,difficulty:3,workload:10},{user:"Georgia Tech Student",reviewDate:"August 1, 2021",semester:"summer 2021",review:`This is a survey course giving you a broad overview of topics but not going in depth on any single one.

The class is project based, which I liked.  5 projects that introduce you to specifics of the topics covered.  Most of them are pretty easy, especially if you have any background in python development.  I personally came with 12 years of software developer experience with my python programming experience being mostly hobbies or automation scripts.  I found the programming pieces really straight forward and relatively simple.  The project instructions will walk you through what you need to do, with very little ambiguity.
The exam isn't too bad even though its cumulative.  Jut make sure you give yourself time to review notes and lectures.

Now coming back to the course, it is overall a great course with good projects.
Also before I proceed further about details, i would like to give a great shout-out to the TA team. TA team is very helpful and also they always made sure they release the grades before any major deadline (sometimes they released within 3-5 days).
I do not have much experience in Networking and security part, so I liked the course overall ( the only improvement would be enhancing the lecture videos to the current topics). The projects are overall great with a decent amount of coding requirement as well ( Project 2 (JavaScript) and Project 5 (Python)).
The course consists of 10 quizzes (10% weightage) , open everything. Not easy to score full marks and some questions will be from related reading papers.
Project 1 (10% weightage) –Easy to Medium  difficulty and doable
Project 2 (10% weightage) -Medium to High  (to very High for some ) – This project has 4 subsections – one of them is creating a chrome extension – needs little hands-on experience. The other one is clickjacking which is updating the DOM of a search result of a shopping store. This needs a decent amount of hands-on in Java Script. And most of the class struggled with this.
Project 3 (20% weightage) – Easy to Medium difficulty – just that you have read a huge write-up, otherwise it is easy to follow the steps kind of work.
Project 4 (20% weightage) – Easy to Medium difficulty – you have to write snort rule – once you understand basic its pretty straight forward
Project 5 (20% weightage) – Medium to High Difficulty – You need to write some amount of Python code after understanding one of the algo in a reading paper.
Final Exam (10% weightage) – Closed everything – Same Difficulty as quizzes – lecture videos and projects understanding in scope ( no additional reading papers).
As I mentioned initially, TA team worked really hard to give provide the grade of Project 5 before the exam date was over( has more than 24 hrs) and this helped as you know how much to score in the exam for your targeted Grade.
Also, there are 2 additional items for feedback on projects which are worth 5% additional weightage.
So overall I liked it and can say if you can score well in projects 2 and 5 , an ‘A’ grade achievable.`,rating:4,difficulty:3,workload:10},{user:"Georgia Tech Student",reviewDate:"April 27, 2021",semester:"spring 2021",review:`Great course with interesting projects.
Project 1 was an introduction to pen testing. If you have experience with Kali Linux tools (e.g. Metasploit) or have done any hack-the-box or CTFs, it's pretty on par with that. The write-up is more of a step-by-step tutorial.
Very easy.
Project 2 was a four part web attack project. The first 3 parts are medium difficulty, but I found click-jacking to be difficult and time-consuming. This project took me the longest to complete, but I have no web development experience outside of IIS. Experience with Javascript and HTML will make this much easier for other students.
Hard.
Project 3 was malware analysis on Windows, Linux, and Android malware samples. No prior experience needed, just three long write-ups to follow.
Medium.
Project 4 was network traffic analysis and intrusion detection using snort. Familiarity with Wireshark is useful here but not required.
Easy.
Project 5 was bypassing an ML security IDS. Very interesting project and I learned a lot. Be prepared to code in Python.
Medium.`,rating:5,difficulty:3,workload:12},{user:"Georgia Tech Student",reviewDate:"April 26, 2021",semester:"spring 2021",review:`Overall a nice course to introduce you to the various attack scenarios though I wish the project could expand further. That would be another course of course. It is not an easy course like some people suggested, as there are quite a few information you need to familiarize yourself with.
The projects each have their own pros and cons and difficulties. Be prepare to spend a lot of time doing your own researches as you need to craft your own codes specific to the projects, and also familiarizing and using new tools for every project. I would say projects 2 and 5 are the most difficult for people who aren't strong with web programming and python. At one point I was seriously considering dropping the course after project 2 spending countless hours in frustration and because the project was a bit vague and not very helpful. Other projects will also take up a lot of time. If you screw up the projects, you are toast, as they take up a huge chunk of your grade.
Beware there are parts of projects that are very tricky. They might lead you to think you have the correct attack solution, but you actually don't. As the saying goes, security through obscurity. If you think you can spend a lot of time in frustration going through loops trying everything you can think of to craft the right attack code or using the tools correctly, then go for it.

The determining factor on how you will feel about this course is your background. If you do not have experience with programming, you will not have a good time in projects 2 and 5.
I would recommend taking IIS to get some understanding of concepts, namely XSS, in order to do well in this class. It is close in difficulty and organization, thus if you did not like IIS, you will likely not care for this course as well. This class is slightly harder than IIS, so if you found it to be very challenging, factor that in to your decision to take this class.
One of the things I loved about the class was the grade distribution. 80% of your grade is based on projects, which is where you will spend most of your time. Each project took me about 10-20 hours to complete.
Projects
Project 1: Penetration testing
You will use various tools to scan for openings and vulnerabilities and take control of a system. Very easy. Follow the write up and you will basically be guaranteed a 100.
Project 2: Advanced Web Security
This was the project most in the class found to be most difficult. If you have experience with web development and manipulating the DOM, this will not be very hard. This project is where IIS and XSS helped out.
Project 3: Advanced Malware Analysis
Possibly the most time consuming due to the massive write up. Not very difficult but really interesting. Follow along with the write up and you will be fine.
Project 4: Network Traffic Analysis
You will use an IDS program called snort to determine which packets are malicious in network traffic. In our term, the TAs opened up the autograder to test your rules which made this project much easier.
Project 5: Machine Learning for Security
You will implement an attack that will bypass machine learning models applied to network packets. Be sure to read and understand the papers that are assigned for this project. You will be implementing the algorithms presented in this paper. This was the most challenging in my opinion, but the most enjoyable.
Quizzes
You will have one quiz each week that is open book/notes. These felt like a chore. My advice is to watch the lectures and scan the papers abstract, results and conclusions to get an idea of where you will need to reference during the quiz. Although I did not read all the papers, there were some very interesting ones that are worth reading.
Final
The final covers the entire class, which was somewhat intimidating, but overall not that bad. One of the saving graces of the final was that it included questions related to the projects, so as long as you understand the concepts the projects are trying to teach, you will pick up some points here.`,rating:5,difficulty:2,workload:12},{user:"Georgia Tech Student",reviewDate:"December 17, 2020",semester:"fall 2020",review:`My first course with OMSCS - took this one up as a challenge to see where I stood. 12 years of IT experience but I was never a full time developer.

Outcome - One BlueJeans meeting with both his course participants. He's really done good work I could tell from the his own papers and endeavors. Wish he spent more time with us OMSCS folks.
Expectation - Lectures will be engaging.
Outcome - Dry, best to read the papers per module (a ton of papers) , then the professor's slides, then watch the videos.
Expectation - Projects will be engaging and require team work.
Outcome - No group projects, very good write ups, good and responsive TAs.

Outcome - Difficulty varied. Even if they are open book, not easy to find answers as the wording is oh so confusing and tricky.
Expectation - Exam - (yes only 1 exam at the end) will be easy. Because hey, I maintained 95%+.
Outcome - Few topics saw more questions, I personally could have done better.
Pro Tips :

Go with an open mind. The more you fight the format and the amount of paper reading, the more you will struggle.
Start all of the projects early. They tend to creep up on you. Some projects will seem like a guided session, really easy. Some will make you go through the motions of - "Oh this should be easy" to "Why did i take this course" to "Oh god, I'm doomed " to "Okay - that was sort of worth it".
If you have never worked with Linux or Javascript or Python, you will find a few projects a little challenging. Nothing you can't overcome though.
Extra credit is really easy work. Don't miss it.
They say you should ideally have done CS6035, I did not feel the need for it, just was tested in a few quiz questions which is the only time I felt I should have taken that before. Then again quizzes have very small weightage.

At the end of the course I came out thinking - "This was really a well paced course, a ton of reading and note taking but worth it".
And I have a more thorough understanding of the subject - loved the malware and bot analysis part.`,rating:4,difficulty:3,workload:8},{user:"Georgia Tech Student",reviewDate:"December 6, 2020",semester:"spring 2020",review:`My Background:  3 years experience in information security as a penetration tester. The content was all very familiar to me. I was working full time while taking this class.
I think this makes a great starter class if you have some sort of background in information security already. The projects will still take quite a bit of time to accomplish so start early. Most of the final grade is based on open book quizzes and the projects, so it is a direct reflection of effort you put into the course.  The closed book exam might be a little more difficult but it was only ~10% of the grade.
Overall I think this was a great introduction to graduate school. The course load is probably less than average of a normal class, maybe closer to average if you don't have any background in information security.

There are 5 projects, the 2nd and 5th (web attacks and ML) required some minor coding, if you're already a full time dev the coding sections will be trivial. If you are new to programming then start those on day 1.
Overall I really enjoyed the projects. The weekly quizzes were pretty awful though. While they were open book, the questions were arbitrary and didn't test actual knowledge.

This is a good introduction to a lot of tools and procedures to dealing with various network attacks/malware, etc. It heavily focuses on projects to that end.

Project Experience
Overall, project 2 and project 5 have the most involvement due to the programming requirements. Project 2 is the most difficult of the 5, as it has the most content and it requires a decent amount of JavaScript programming to get full marks. Project 5 is difficult, but the required programming is simple once you understand what it is asking of you. Projects 1, 3, and 4 I was able to complete in a day or less. I believe that they are revamping it so that each project has an autograder to give you the ability to check where you are at, but I am unsure. We had the autograder for Project 1 and 4, and Project 5 had a "local autograder" included in the VM. Overall, these were pleasant projects, and enjoyed the challenge of some.
Content Experience
I didn't like the video lectures - I believe that they could easily summarize them into a few videos instead of arbitrarily timed ones. The mid video quizzes were distracting. The weekly quizzes were often obscure and will have questions about the papers usually, but they are open book. The final is not, but the final seemed to be less focused on paper and obscure questions and more focused around the projects and some of the more straightforward quiz questions.
Why should you take this?
Take this if: you have an interest in vulnerabilities and attacks on networks and how to mitigate them. The content is interesting for sure, especially if you are like me and don't get a chance in the industry to cross into this side of IT (Back end dev).`,rating:4,difficulty:2,workload:10},{user:"Georgia Tech Student",reviewDate:"November 20, 2020",semester:"fall 2020",review:`Lectures:
There's 20 lectures spread out over 13 modules. They provide a high level overview of the topic and can be completed between 30-45 minutes each. The topics are as follows: DDOS, Cybercrimes, Penetration Testing, Browser Security Models, Web Session Management, HTTPS, Security of Internet Protocols, DNS Security, Malware Analysis, Mobile Malware, Cloud Computing & VM Monitoring, Property Preserving Encryption & Oblivious RAM, Botnet Detection, Internet Scale Threat Analysis & Scanning, Domain & Network Reputation, ML for Security, Data Poisoning & Model Evasion, Blockchain & Bitcoin, Alternative Cryptocurrencies, and Attack Tolerant Systems.
Reading Material:
Each module has around 3-5 papers that you should read. They provide an in-depth explanation of various topics discussed in the lectures. The papers averaged around 15 pages each and are dull reads but are essential for doing well on the quizzes and learning the topics. There is no required textbook for this class but there is an optional book called the Hackers Playbook. I recommend ordering the second edition if you are interested in learning about penetration testing or bug bounty hunting. The first can be skipped due to it being more of a rough draft to the second edition. The third edition covers red team topics. None are needed for the quizzes.
Quizzes:
There are 10 quizzes throughout the course and they cover material discussed in the lectures and reading. They are under 10 questions each and are true/false or multiple choice questions. Some questions are poorly worded. The quizzes total up to 10% of your final grade and are open note.
Final Exam:
The exam is closed book, 25 questions and is similar to the quizzes style and format. It's worth 10% of your total grade and covers material from the lectures and projects.
Projects:
There are 5 projects worth a total of 80% of your grade.
Project 1: Exploiting a web server with Kali,
Project 2: Various client side attacks,
Project 3: Static and dynamic malware analysis (Linux/Windows/Android),
Project 4: Detecting malicious traffic with SNORT,
Project 5: Bypassing a ML based IDS with polymorphic blending.
I found the projects to be enjoyable. Each one took 3-5 nights to complete with project 2 being the most difficult due to needing clarification on the write up and fine tuning JavaScript behavior.
Overall:
This class is worth taking if you have an interest in cybersecurity. I recommend coming into this course with an introductory level knowledge of computer networks, security, JavaScript and Python. Introduction to Information Security and Computer Networks are possible classes you can take before taking this course if you want to prepare for it. Information Security Lab - System and Network Defenses would be a good follow up course for more practice.`,rating:4,difficulty:2,workload:10},{user:"Georgia Tech Student",reviewDate:"November 9, 2020",semester:"fall 2020",review:`Breakdown

The project with snort is an interesting one the write up should be modified slightly to illustrate clear deductions and really showcase where the deductions could come from other students had an issue with i didnt thank goodness but easy to get tripped on it  Overall this project wasnt bad pretty straight forward.

They're really just for a high-level overview of topics, with the expectation that you should read the assigned papers to get more depth. Recreating the lectures would also be an opportunity to clean up the "flow"; there are lectures in which Prof. Lee abruptly switches from one topic to another with no attempt at a transition. They're also peppered with fairly useless "knowledge checks" that will quiz you on random statistics you'd have no way of knowing beforehand, or other trivia like vocabulary that hasn't been covered in the lecture.
Projects: the content is good, but the instructions really need to be rewritten completely. They often contained contradictions or ambiguities or broken English, and even references to past semesters' versions of the projects. Nowhere close to enough quality control here.
Project 1 - web exploits. Okay project, but the inclusion of a Chrome extension has nothing to do with security and was seemingly just thrown in to artificially increase the difficulty.
Project 2 - advanced malware analysis. Probably the worst offender in terms of poorly-written instructions. Instructions consist of a 110+ page Powerpoint (smh), another 40ish page Powerpoint, and a 15ish page PDF.
Project 3 - network traffic analysis and differentiation with Snort.
Project 4 - machine learning for security. The first two parts of the project are just parameter tuning, while the third actually involves coding.
Extra credit project - Shellshock. By far the shortest project, and should only take you an hour or two to complete.
Quizzes: like in IIS, the quizzes don't require a lot of critical thinking and are just there to make sure you're keeping up with the readings. Better edited questions than in IIS, but they could still be more substantive.
Exam: basically like the quizzes, only covering all the lectures and closed-book.
TAs: decent overall. Fast grading. They could stand to be more responsive on Piazza (fellow students were far more active in answering each other's questions).

However, personally, I feel all projects are good enough to provide directions and hints for you to proceed. This course relates to network security, so each project is like solving a puzzle or exploiting the code vulnerability as a “hacker”. We should not expect the project description provides all detailed information about what to do.

-quizzes are unintelligible, random, and artificially difficult. Not worth the time or the stress.
-final is just as bad question-wise BUT the exam is cumulative and access to notes is not allowed.
-Lecture content and assigned project in a given few weeks are completely irrelevant. Impossible to connect the dots between the two.
-Project writeups are poorly written - contain outdated instructions from past semesters. Also, they don't get to the point. A lot of noise on what turns out to be a straight-forward concept adds unnecessary confusion.
Projects:
-Project 1 takes care of itself
-Project 2 is insanely difficult. Clickjacking isn't easy for the average joe.

The first part was changed from filter writing to filter bypass - so you either figured out what they were looking for early on or some students spent 10-30 hours working on this section alone. This led to the web server crashing and an extension being posted. This is the weed-out project - I will say it's incredibly satisifying once you get it but also incredibly frustrating.
Time breakdown:
Project 1: About 5 hours
Project 2: 35+ hours easily
Project 3: 10 hours
Project 4: 10 hours
Project 5: 10 hours
Other than Project 2 - it really isn't a bad class. Project 3 is actually pretty fun, Project 4 is not very challenging with Python and Project 5 provided just the right amount of hand holding.
Overall - know what you're getting into it. The TAs were very reasonable and if you can make it through Project 2 you can do well in the class.`,rating:2,difficulty:3,workload:12},{user:"Georgia Tech Student",reviewDate:"May 1, 2020",semester:"spring 2020",review:`FYI: first course in program, "non-traditional" background, still got an A, so I don't have too much salt in my mouth about this course.
Quizzes: Open book, leaned on that aspect a lot to get by on quizzes. Based off the slack chat, my incoming knowledge was bottom tier coming into the class as compared to my classmates, but I scored well on this section.
Projects: 5 of them total. All were interesting and varying in length. This is by far the bulk of my time in this class was spent on. My strategy was to really focus the week that it was due, which didn't kill me here. I agree that sometimes I felt the write ups could have been communicated clearer and had better overall organization, but I can't decide if that's just the nature of graduate level courses. I think I only used javascript and python during these projects, btw. Had to write snort rules in some funky language and i used some obscure language for android malware analysis.
Final: 25 MC and T/F, closed book exam over the entire course. Either you know it or you don't. The TAs did a good job laying out topics to study for.
Extra Credit: Just give feedback to the TAs of ways to improve each project, and they will significantly help your grade.

TL;DR: if you are interested in learning and solving the security problems of network, and you have at least some web or network knowledge, you will definitely learn or re-learn a lot through this course.
It's really hard to tell the background of the people who wrote the reviews. In my class, there were people who couldn't even run their VM correctly when reaching the project deadline.
I think this course is not for everyone:

if you don't have a general idea of what is happening when you type a url and get a web page rendered in your browser.
if you don't know what javascript is, or you are not OK to write javascript for XSS attack.
if you don't like to read/exploit code in a programming language you don't know (C or Java).
if you can't write some python code.
if you don't like to play in a hacker's mindset, or take experiment-based projects, where a black box type of system is given, and you have to spend hours of trial and error to understand how it works or how to break it.

Again this is a graduate level course about network security. It's better if you know how network works before taking this course, or you should expect to spend more time figuring this out (It is still manageable IMO), or you will end up hating this course a lot.
CS6035 (IIS) might be a better course if you still want to learn some security basis. And CS6250(Computer Networks) is also a good choice to understand how network works.`,rating:4,difficulty:3,workload:12},{user:"Georgia Tech Student",reviewDate:"January 4, 2020",semester:"fall 2019",review:`Overall, I have mixed feelings about this course.
The content and material that you learn is really interesting.
The way it's delivered and the pedagogy used is terrible.
I give this course a 8/10 on content and a 2/10 on delivery.
This was my first class at OMSCS and I kept finding myself saying: "There must be some mistake - why is the best online CS program in the world offering an experience like this?"
Here's the breakdown:
The lectures:
You spend maybe 1/3 of your time viewing lectures. The lectures provide interesting content that's well structured and reasonably delivered. In terms of transmitting knowledge to your brain, these do a pretty good job. My only qualm is about the ungraded quizzes that are sprinkled throughout - these usually quiz you on stuff that wasn't in the lectures. Pretty weird and annoying to test for knowledge you haven't given if you ask me.
The projects:
You spend a little less than 2/3 of your time on projects. The subject matter covered by the projects is really interesting. The way that subject matter is delivered is garbage. The projects related to the material in the lectures only in a theoretical sense - you're on your own to learn the specific implementation details - which is tough because the details are 90% of the projects.
Every write up had typos, grammatical errors, and just plain wasn't organized well. Each writeup was also organized differently from the last. I imagine they were all created by separate non-native english speaking graduate students during a semester project. It's fine if English isn't your first language, just get somebody who does speak English natively to proofread you writing!
The projects turned on very small details that were often ambiguously defined in the writeups. I'd say 50-80% of your project time was spent wrestling with the writeups and implementation details (setting up VMs, network tools, etc). Overall, the projects were challenging not because of the material, but because of the way the material was communicated.
The quizzes:
The quizzes are short, simple, and trivia based. By trivia, I mean the questions tested specific, rote knowledge rather than meaningful, synthesized knowledge. I personally don't think rote knowledge is very knowledgeable vis-a-vis synthesized knowledge, but that's just me.
The final:
The final was much like the quizzes, but covered the all the lectures instead of just one or two. It was even more trivia based and therefore I felt that it didn't test anything meaningful. I basically just reviewed my notes for 20 mins beforehand and got a 70. In order to get a 90 I believe you'd have to put in significantly more time (on the order of 2-6 hours).

I paired it with Graduate Algorithms. I found the beginning of this course to have a lot of overlap with Intro to Info Sec. After the first month or so it the content did branch away from Info Sec. This class is structured very similarly to Info Sec. Mainly project based. Final exam. Quizzes. I found the projects to be pretty easy (usually finished them in a day) but very insightful. I enjoyed learning from the projects. The lectures were harder to learn from. Just like Info Sec the professor tries to teach too much in every video - makes it hard to focus. Plus, I never found a connection between the videos and the projects. The quizzes and videos quickly begin to feel like busy work. I think this class would be better if it had one more project and dropped either the final exam or the quizzes. During the semester I took the class we had a month for the last project. So this would be a good class to pair with another class that has a lot of work towards the end of the semester. I also wish the TAs would have graded things with a little more care. I had to submit regrade requests for every project. Also, the project's instructions were really hard to follow sometimes.

Projects are in general alright - the writeup (instructions) are just awful though - very ambiguous at times, but they require you to be very specific - taking points off if you had a different understanding of the (ambiguous) instructions - Piazza was full of posts asking for clarifications, since people were afraid some stupid misunderstanding would result in lower grades.

Cons: The quiz and exam questions were ambiguous about 10% of the time. Canvas access to the course was revoked prior to the end of the semester with no notice to students and no way to ever get back into it. There was no opportunity to review missed questions on the final exam.
Grading:

Cons:
Only project related questions are answered by TAs. When I had questions about the slides and videos, there would be no replies. There are a lot of white papers to read. We had 10 quizzes, with multiple choice questions that are deliberately misleading and the final fashioned in the same way.

tldr; Don't take this class unless you have to.
This class is not hard. It is poorly designed and poorly administrated. I averaged 18 hours a week on it and got a B. That should be broken down to 6 hours of productive work and 12 hours of frustration/time wasted. On almost every lab, some requirement was elaborated on in a piazza thread by the instructor in a way that changed the approach to doing the lab.
I'll start with the positives to be fair. This is a very interesting topic. I enjoyed learning about it in spite of the way the course was being run. The scope of the material is ambitious and that is not a bad thing.  The slack channel was very helpful and active because nothing brings people together like complaining about the same things.
On the other hand:
Weekly quizzes and the final are checking if you can use ctrl+F effectively on slides/papers. Most questions are word for word from a lecture or paper except usually with a trick like one word had been changed. Many questions do not use logically sound English.
Labs requirements aren't well communicated. (One lab's write-up was an 106 page slide deck smh). If you happen to be very familiar with the topic ahead of time you will probably get by. If you are not familiar your best bet is another student walking you through it. The lecture material does not. The lab material was heplful maybe half the time. These topics include python, javascript, chrome extenstions, HTML, CSS, Disassembly code,  android architecture, Regex, Machine Learning basics.
The lectures are barely worth mentioning because they do little more than provide a 2 minute version of the topics you'll have to do a whole lab on. They aren't really good or bad. You need to watch them for the final/quizzes which will test how well you can memorize random statements out of them.
I'll give the instructor and TAs the benefit of the doubt that they were doing their best to make a good class, but that was not the result.

Disregard everything the syllabus or anything else says about the course requirements or prerequisites.  You need an expert level knowledge of Python, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Chrome extension development, executable disassembly in Linux and Windows, radare2, ida pro, ANGR, SNORT, Wireshark, and machine learning just to do the projects -- and you won't have time to get it if you don't.  Each of the projects would be either a full semester or 1/2 semester course at any other school -- and the course makes absolutely no attempt to teach you any of the things you need to know in order to complete any of them.  The teaching philosophy is "go read the papers the professor wrote".  The lectures are a high level overview of small pieces of the information you need, but make no attempt to actually get into detail on anything -- they're completely useless.  In fact, they remind me of CIS101 type lectures in terms of their depth.  Additionally, the projects are so poorly defined that they have to be continually questioned and re-questioned to get some idea of what the TAs are actually looking for.
And the quizzes.  Everyone's favorite.  If you've ever taken a Comptia test, this is equivalent.  Not in difficulty, in the requirement to memorize obscure (and often incorrect) bits of useless information hidden deep in the depths of 10+ year old research papers in order to find the least incorrect answer in the confusing mess of distractors.  Each quiz violates every principle of multiple choice exam development, using the most confusing language possible to artificially inflate the difficulty.  Every question is a trick question.
The professor and the TAs?  Dismissive, don't care, basically tell the students to go jump in a lake any time questions they don't like are raised.  That's the only time the absentee professor shows up, in fact, is to berate students whose questions he doesn't like.
Final exam?  Well, they pretend it's not exactly a final by omitting two lectures from the lecture list for the final, so that they can make it required outside of the final exam timeframe required by the university.  It's the kind of technicality a lawyer would love, I suppose.  And they use proctortrack, and they require you to use a mirror to show the rest of the room around you, and threaten to give you a zero on the exam if they can't see your mirror scan well enough -- and you can't re-do the mirror scan, and you can't see the mirror scan in the 1"x1" display in proctortrack, so there's no way to know if you did it well enough.  Multiple requests to show the room with the webcam or rotate the laptop around were ignored or answered with "use a mirror".  The course is actually more focused on anti-cheating than it is on teaching the material -- which is a shame because the course subject is a very interesting subject, and if taught well this would be a premiere course in this program.  ETA:  Well, the final is finished and graded.  Class-wide, we identified over 20 of the 35 questions as being incorrect, contradictory, or otherwise broken.  They didn't publish the class average, but based on the industry professionals in the course, my guess is the average was less than 40%.  We'll see what final grades are when they're posted.

If you want to learn about security, this is a fine place to be.

You will hate the quizzes because they feel like someone wrote them trying to trap you into giving the wrong answer. However, you will see some pretty interesting stuff, and the final is only worth 10% of your grade.

The assignments were good. detailed explained. difficulty level were OK. not too difficult and not too easy. languages used were python and javascipt regular knowledge of Linux and some script was good to have

The quizzes sometimes I feel were not worded properly and were ambiguous causes regrade.

No one simply wants to make the effort to upgrade that project and the course to the level of AI or CV. I shared in the frustration but I have experienced the same in SAT so I can't single out this course as being especially awful. The quizzes require careful reading but are pretty easy points.

I would only recommend this to students who are brand new to network security due to the broad range of topics covered.

Warning: The instructor was not engaged in the course. This course is taught by TAs and centered on projects run by TAs. Expect rude responses on piazza.
Read the reviews! I regret not paying heed to the [negative] course reviews. As a veteran of several OMSCS courses, this was the worst. Despite the problems, I learned a lot about Network Security [lectures and readings], and couple of projects were enjoyable and worth the effort.
Network Security has a reputation as being a less challenging course, but difficulty may be normalized. One way to increase difficulty would be to cover material in greater depth or expand covered material. The approach chosen by this course seemed to add work and make project descriptions indecipherable. Many OMSCS students have extensive IT experience, often in the practical tools used in this course. You need to learn Wireshark, Snort, web development, javascript, etc, to be successful.
The course lectures are an overview of the material; lecture notes are provided. Listen to the lectures and review the notes, as they introduce concepts. Most of the course content lies in the readings and the projects.
There were tons of readings between the papers (over 60), and books (penetration testing, bitcoin, etc).  Many of these readings were excellent, and clearly conveyed extensive information about security, although a few papers were undecipherable. One can try to discern which readings are important, and which less relevant. Since many readings are not relevant to the projects, quizzes or final, a less motivated student could skip 80% of the papers, avoid much of the knowledge presented in the course, and still earn an A or B.
There were five projects (80% of course grade). The projects were disconnected. Each approached a different aspect of network security. Project descriptions varied in quality, and ranged from clear and understandable (great) to undecipherable (terrible). The general impression is that the projects were a tragic mess.
The hardest part of the course was the struggle to puzzle out what was needed to succeed on the projects.  The TAs shared crucial information in office hours and on slack. Follow these channels as well as piazza, as a summary of slack/office hours are not provided on piazza.
One project was composed of two sub-projects. One part used regular expressions (literature consensus repudiates approach) and expected students to guess what patterns to detect. Another used javascript and iframe(s), and many students were unable to guess the trick. Many students did not guess how to perform parts, and the average was ~50%. Do not expect TAs to provide guidance, even after the project is completed.
Another project required students to detect malicious behavior in packet captures, learn snort, and construct rules to detect the patterns.  The project seemed more about finding needles in haystacks (malicious packets in captures), than learning how to effectively use snort as an IDS. Half of the points were a summary report from detected packet patterns. The all-or-nothing grading was harsh. Expect to request regrades.
Another project writeup specified one-one or one-many to perform blending attacks, but TAs announced that only one approach would gain full marks. Alternative solutions and critical thinking were not rewarded. The TAs announced rubric changes mid-project (read all piazza posts). Students were graded by different criteria depending upon when project submitted.
Since TAs effectively taught the course, one relied upon TAs to provide a good experience. The tone of the TAs on piazza was generally rude and defiant (bordered on abusive), and the course was an unpleasant experience.
There were ten quizzes, open book & notes, extremely easy, but with specific open & close dates. Grading criteria changed mid-course from multiple attempts to single attempt. The quizzes were busy work and an exercise in time-management.

Projects are significantly tough. Add to the complexity, the wordings and some parts of the projects are frustratingly ambiguous
Grading  projects takes a LOOONG time. Project 2 grades and feedback didn't come until project 4 is released, making it really hard for students to make a decision on whether to drop it or not.
If you get the code completely working, you will get good grades. If it is partially working, expect to get close to nothing.
Leaving out some of the instructions like uploading all the files everytime in canvas will result in 0 marks. In contrast, Other courses are okay with just uploading changed files and their autograder works fine.
10 hours per week is a really underestimated efforts. You should have been in the slack channel for project 2 or project 3 to see how many hours students put in. Each of them were well over 40 hours each. This is coming from someone that is half way in the program with a perfect GPA and have done well in many of the courses.

lectures were not always great and only partly helpful in actual learning
some of the quizzes and final had random knowledge questions that have pretty little value in actually knowing but fortunately most of the grade is made up of projects

Pros:

projects are pretty interesting and you learn a lot doing them
Quizzes are stupidly easy, but they play tricks with wording.
easy A if you have the time to figure out wtf they want from you

Cons:

the projects, while interesting, are terrible with defining requirements. Literally awful at it. You will spend so much time figuring out what the projects actually are asking you to do. It is insane how much time was wasted figuring out the project requirements.
the quizzes I was talking about before are stupidly easy, but they are barely like the exam. There's no practice exam, and the quizzes don't help to study for the final.
The quizzes are written through a language barrier, which would be fine, but the problem is the questions also sometimes have careful tricks in their wording. This is going to sound confusing, but there will be a lot of times where you'll be wondering about what the question is really intending to convey so that you can answer it correctly. You'll know the concept it's asking about 90% of the time, but you'll get shot in the foot by wording if you're not careful. It's done to a degree that isn't constructive because each quiz might only have like 4-10 questions.
I frame busted my life dude. project 2 is terrible. seriously.
There were no office hours. I heard nothing about video conferences either. Totally absent on slack and piazza.
The TA's are very hard to reach. I only posted twice to them because I knew I wouldn't get an answer, and indeed I didn't. whack. Props to one TA William Lucas though for being quite helpful. And also props to the students who hashed out the requirements on Piazza with the TA's kicking and screaming.
I also took IIS before this with the same professor. Honestly I have yet to see any actual proof that Professor Lee actually exists. I'm pretty sure he's just a concept used to refer to a loose collective of overworked graduate students that are laundering money through the university for a professor's salary and trying to funnel it into their crappy startup idea preventing ridiculous FERPA violations from happening in American universities.

For those who already have relevant experience and background, it will not extend in-depth knowledge.
I took the course in hope of extending my knowledge in network security due to the strong interest in this topic. Professor Li probably is an excellent researcher and expert in this field, but the course is not well organized and taught. The lecture videos don’t talk about the tools and techniques necessary for completing the projects. This is specifically true for project 2 and I believe many students dropped after finishing project 2.
Pros:

A wide range of topics are covered in the lecture videos .
Classmates are helpful in both Piazza and Slack.

Cons:

The prerequisite for programming background is misleading. It says that prior programming experience with C or Java is recommended. This is not true. The projects use Python, JavaScript and HTML.
Videos are completely irrelevant to the projects. It covers a wide range of topics but it’s way too generic and are not helpful for the implementation of the projects. I feel like it’s a waste of time.
Recommended readings are over-assigned. 1 out of the 12 lessons is assigned every week. Here are the numbers, the recommended readings are a 358 pages book for lesson 3, 11 papers/webpages for lesson 5, and 6 papers (15 pages on average) for lesson 6. I would say it is more than a full-time PhD candidate’s reading. Most importantly, those reading materials are not relevant to the projects, you must spend extra hours on the projects.
The write-ups of the five projects are all full of confusions and errors. During the first several days of the release of each project, students would raise bunch of questions on Piazza and Slack to clarify the requirement and instructions. The TAs also had to change the policy in the middle of the projects several times, which was horribly frustrating, especially for those who started the projects earlier.
Prof. Li is entirely absent from the class for the whole semester. Some of the TAs never reply emails.

The professor is completely disengaged and unfortunately, the main TA this year was pretty rude and unforgiving to a lot of people who asked questions on Piazza. I would rate this course a Very Hard in terms of understanding what is actually expected of you, but Easy in terms of actual content.
Honestly, the assignments were not challenging as long as you read every single Piazza post, even if there were dozens. Because I did not do that and just did the assignments as outlined on the assignment description (generally taking around 10 hours for each assignment), without fail, I would receive anywhere from 50-70% on every assignment, and then be forced to request a regrade and claw back points. Every regrade gave me 20+ points, so they are definitely worth it, but it is an absolutely ridiculous process if you think about the effort TAs have to put in to basically grade everything twice because they were not explicit in the assignment instructions the first time or their autograder was just wrong.
You would think since this class is so poorly managed, that you would be allowed to ask clarifying questions on Piazza, but after one TA repeatedly responded in a downright rude manner to anyone's innocent questions, I decided to forgo that strategy and just rely on the obnoxious regrading requests to get an accurate grade.
Also don't expect the final to be any less vague or subjective than the quizzes you do all semester.

I was very motivated and wanted to excel. I watched every single weekly video and read all suggested materials. I took many notes and was very serious. However, this course is a complete pleasantry. Let me explain.


The weekly videos are someone reading the slide without giving any content. The slides are extracted from whitepapers and mostly just the first paragraph of each subject. The videos do not explain; they give outlines of many topics.


Each week has too many covered subjects. It's tough to understand everything with the lack of material. Whitepapers are not clear, long to read and a lot of additional web research is required. Videos took me about 1h on average to consume and white papers about 10h. The remaining time was invested in projects.


Projects are not related to the lectures. In fact, the projects cover one topic of about 30 discussed in the three weeks the project cover.


TAs only answer project answers. Several questions about whitepapers were never answered.


Projects are not well constructed. Lots of information are given during the timeframe of the assignment making people working late on the project with a considerable advantage. Some projects requirements were written over +70 PowerPoint slides.


Quiz answers are all available on Internet.


Final tests are made to trick you. Many questions were related to a subject seen, but the question was touching an area not covered by the lecture. You had to know about the subject deeply to answer. The final exam had many errors (English and structural).


Projects worth the most in this course. 5 of them took between 20 to 45 hours to complete. Spread over 2-3 weeks per project it becomes a burden with the whitepapers and videos. The two combined explain why I have an average of about 22 hours per week.


Prof Lee is entirely absent from this course. The TAs are doing their best, but they are swamped by assignments questions which prove the lack of cleanliness as well as the disconnect between the material and the projects.


They mention buying a book (200 pages). After reading half of it, I realized that it was a waste of time and money. There was a single page that was barely usable for a single project. A student asked about the book and no TA, neither the professor answered about how important was the book was for the class.


It was my first course, and if GaTech is running this way, I'll stop. The quality is deficient of this course, and it is evident that there was no real intention to teach anything else than cramping a lot of subjects in little time to make it hard.

The lectures are extremely dry. It's like Prof. Lee has taken a text book and simply read the contents on there.
The lectures are simply a mish mash of materials. Just a bunch of concepts thrown in.
The TAs are not very active. The ones that are provide confusing and sometimes contradictory answers.
The project writeups are mostly poorly written, requiring lots of clarifications from TAs. Almost all projects (except the first) had lots of clarifications, some coming as late as  a couple of days before submission. So if you are the early bird types, forget about submitting early.
There is no autograder you have access to - no way for you to know if you've made a silly mistake in your project. Given that it's binary grading (you either get all points for a section or lose it all), you simply are out of luck if you made a silly mistake.

I have to really highlight that NO instructions were provided.  For example in one of the projects we were required to utilize a well known security tool and you were graded on your implementation of that tool, but no instructions or examples were given and that left some students wondering why they didn't just invest the money in taking a class to learn that toolset from another provider.
In my case I had to drop because of the time commitments (I work 40+ hours and run a business on the side) and because after getting As on other projects and assignments I received a terrible score on one project and could not recover.  Unfortunately, although I had put in 60 hours of work in and I could demonstrate the logic in my code was correct and met stated requirements, the TAs provided no credit on account of how they expected it to function (requirements that were unstated and undocumented).  Truthfully I received so little feedback and so few instructions that I withdrew in part because I realized I would learn more with my time and money spent elsewhere (ex: CCNA).

The lectures are shallow, fast paced, incomplete, and often a waste of time. The full lessons are usually 15-25 minutes long. The professor will introduce a complex topic and spend 1-4 minutes going through it. The pentesting lecture was pathetic, honestly. It's nothing more than some slides name dropping tools with no input on how to use them, and the reading for the section is an entire book on pentesting. And all the lessons are this way. Network monitoring, malware analysis, etc. are all briefly plowed through with no detail or exploration. The lecture quizzes often contain questions that weren't covered in the lectures or the reading, which highlights how thin the actual learning material is.
The projects are annoying. Often times there's a VM you have to download and setup, but they are riddled with errors. Tons of Piazza posts troubleshooting the VMs that launch without the correct updates and are fragile. The projects themselves often require spending a ton of time learning about very specific things to "hack together" the end result the instructors are looking for. The projects and lectures don't work together in any way; the projects require lots of learning of topics that are never taught by the instructors. Several of the projects were also very specific and not really accurate to real world situations.

Each required re-configuring, setup, or installations which were time consuming and error prone. On more than one project I spent more time setting up the environment than I did completing actual work.
Final thoughts: don't take this in the summer, and brush up on Linux, Virtual Box, port scanning, Snort, and JavaScript first. Go in with the expectation that this is a self-taught course, and expect to spend a LOT of time on Piazza. Start projects as soon as they become available and set aside plenty of time to work on them each day.`,rating:2,difficulty:5,workload:15},{user:"Georgia Tech Student",reviewDate:"August 14, 2017",semester:"summer 2017",review:`I would strongly agree with one of the other comments here "Projects didn't tie in much with the lectures and lacked a lot of clarity, but were enjoyable".

The projects were well balanced between being exciting, very cool and the same time posed a little bit of challenge once in a while. The course work along with the projects took a good 10hrs per week which included a quiz that was posted every friday covering the lecture material for that week.
The weekly quiz ensured that we were also up-to-date on the lectures so if you planning to take a week off during the course, you might need to plan that a bit.

Some had intended answers not yet covered. Others had you ordering exploits by how common they are or ordering some other set of things with some other metric, also without prior coverage. To summarize, many of the lecture quizzes don't evaluate what you've learned from previous lecture material or the readings for that matter. So you just end up skipping to the answer and learning what you were supposed to answer. The projects were also interesting but had unspecified requirements that had to be clarified by the TAs constantly in Piazza and during office hours. If you don't pay attention to Piazza, then you are quite likely to lose 10+ points on a project you implemented according to the project's specifications, so pay close attention to Piazza. At least once, there was a detail provided during office hours that required many students to refactor their code even though the justification for this change was unfounded. The TAs were generally very helpful and patient in Piazza, which somewhat makes up for the instructor being completely absent. Several students who clearly just didn't do the work or started projects too late and did poorly, begged for a curve at the end despite the vast majority of the class getting As.

My expectations for the class were to lean about network security and ways to prevent attacks or make it harder for attacks to happen. After the course I would say some of these expectations were met.
The course feels like a great overview of some of the security vulnerabilities in the existing structure of networks and the internet. It provides a nice way to experience being a white hacker to test your defenses and learn how to improve them.
The course was not well thought out, and assignment issues caused students to have their access revoked due to not following GT IT policies. The majority of the assignments were hard to understand and much clarification was needed due to not being fully vetted. Many times the instructors told students to start early, and then those who did were penalized because they had to redo assignments based on the erratas that were released later, often a week into or days before the due date. Be prepared to monitor ALL Piazza and slack communications daily, even after you submit assignments in case the requirements change for what needs to be submitted.
Overall, the course had great potential and learning opportunities, but was dulled by the inconsistencies, errors, and lack of communication from the instructors.
The Professor must have been too involved in his research to even care about his students or class. He did not even post a single comment and was not involved in the class at all.

The course is completely led by the TAs, other than the pre-recorded videos I don't think the professor contributed anything on Piazza etc. In some classes this can work, but not so well in this case as there was a lack of clear guidance when there was an anomaly.
I did learn quite a bit and what I did learn was interesting. The assignments were painful in terms of having to work through incorrect or ambiguous instructions. In some projects then there would be a comment in Piazza that clarified something or corrected an error but that would be late into the project and in some cases meant repeating the project. It also meant that you had to spend a lot of time on Piazza, not just reading every post once but going back to see if an instructor had added a comment at a later date. I spent a lot of time re-working the projects which I feel was time wasted. For one of the projects it is still ambiguous as to why we had to do something a particular way and it has not been explained despite several attempts at asking.
In addition one project involving zmap Internet scanning resulted in many students being flagged by the IT department as performing unauthorized Internet scanning. This is something that should have been cleared with them in advance by the professor.

I am bitter because this class was an laughable waste of time.

) The lectures were mostly terrible. On occasion, there was an OK lecture, but by and large they were far too shallow to be useful.


) The projects were riddled with problems. Very often, issues with the projects would be figured out deep in the comments of Piazza and there would never be an update or an announcement to the class that the problem was found, so if you didn't read /everything/ in Piazza, you were probably running in circles.


) The professor delegated nearly everything to the TAs and the TAs were /terrible/


) Grading was cryptic and ridiculous. Forgot the "www. " on a URL even though you verified it wasn't in the packet? Doesn't matter, that's 1% of your final course grade. Got the solution working 90% of the way? Oh, that's a 0 because nowhere did it say it was all or nothing, which translates to 5% of your final course grade. TAs had to regrade nearly every project and it was like pulling teeth to get them to realize their mistakes. As well, they never released the answers, so we just have to trust them after all their fumbles.


) I learned nothing. I think the longest project took me 6 hours and the shortest about 2 hours and it would've been very easy to do each one without watching the lectures or reading the papers.


This class has great potential, but in its current form it's absolutely terrible. In hindsight, I wish I had taken anything else or nothing at all. Steer clear, if you can.

The professor didn't leave a single - not one - email or announcement or comment or anything. He could be mythical for all I know.

Professor Lee never communicated with students a single time. When a project was shut down when students got emails from GA Tech Cyber Security telling them they were violating institute policy and potentially federal law, there was silence. When the final project was based around a paper he authored and questions were posted regarding both practical and theoretical application of the concepts, there was silence. The instructor could have been listed as "Mickey Mouse" and the student experience would have been the same.
Other instructors were not much help either. If you have a question about something in a project writeup, be prepared to be told to re-read the writeup ad nauseum or to literally beg for clarification on Piazza and then get ignored. Expect cryptic or poorly-worded responses from instructors buried in random threads with no further clarifications provided, and private posts to go unresolved for entire project windows. One TA did hold weekly office hours and actively participated in Slack and Piazza, but it just wasn't enough.
Students were also limited in their ability to help each other, despite the lack of instructor participation. Trying to give hints or troubleshoot led to one occasion of instructors threatening students with honor code violations. Solutions to past projects were also deemed off-limits due to the fear of withdrawn students hiding on Piazza to learn the solutions. If you didn't figure it out yourself, too bad.

To be fair: it's clear that Dr. Lee is an expert in security, and the instructor and TAs all did a fine job organizing Piazza etc. And, on the plus side, the class is purely project-based, and the projects are almost entirely "color by the numbers, " so if you can just follow the detailed instructions you are given you should be able to finish each project eventually and even get an A.
Be prepared, though, the projects are very concrete and steps you need to follow very clear, but that doesn't mean it's easy. Some of the projects can be huge time sucks while you basically guess and check to find an acceptable answer.
On the negative side, I found the lectures very poor, like watching a video of someone reading flash cards. They contain frequent "quizzes" where the quiz itself is the instructional material. These aren't recaps of anything that is covered elsewhere, it's guess-and-check until you can match a bunch of terms (which you may never have heard of) to their definition, or the exact short answer they want to a vague and open-ended question. The next segment of the video will of course, not discuss the terms you just learned, but move on to something else. It's basically like having wikipedia read to you.
Too often this class felt like going on a tour of the chocolate factory, being quickly rushed from room to room and being told briefly what the machines are called, then having the warning labels read out loud to you.

It was one of the easiest out of the 7 classes I have taken so far. Only a few hours of work a week.
Like others mentioned there are only 4 projects that make up your grade. They are not too difficult and do not take up much time. The first is doing a frame busting exploit and creating a Chrome extension/exploit with Javascript. I have never used Javascript before and found it easy to Google what I needed. Youtube videos helped with creating the Chrome extension.
The second project involved doing malware analysis using some command line tools and Wireshark while running malware in a VM. If you have not used Wireshark you can find some how to Youtube videos to show you how to find data in packets.
The third was doing some more packet analysis with Wireshark and writing firewall rules using IP Tables. This project along with the first two took less than 10 hours each.
The fourth was implementing an exploit in an IDS by modifying some Python code. This one took me the longest to do of the four (about 15 hours total) but ended up only being less than 20 lines of Python. Most of it was trying to make sense of what the exploit was doing from reading a couple white papers and figuring out how to code it.
We had the option to either take an optional final exam or complete and extra assignment for 10% extra credit! You could choose 1 of 3 projects. I chose one that was an extension of the second official project in the class and only took me an hour and about 4 lines of Python code. Another one that looked interesting involved doing a port scan of the entire IPv4 address space for vulnerabilities.
If you liked the IT Security class you will like this one. The professor and TA’s were very helpful. It is very similar in workload and content and very easy. I haven’t got my final grade but I would guess ending up near 105% with the extra credit.`,rating:5,difficulty:1,workload:3},{user:"Georgia Tech Student",reviewDate:"December 6, 2016",semester:"fall 2016",review:`This class had some issues for a first run, but ultimately was a positive experience, especially for those pursuing computing systems specializations. The problems were mainly with pacing of the course and specifics with the project details. There were many dead spots throughout the semester and the projects had evolving instructions / descriptions. I expect these issues to be worked out in subsequent semesters. For those who have taken InfoSec, This course is VERY similar.
Lots of opportunities for extra credit, some of the projects are reminiscent of Info Sec as well. The class was project based, with each of 4 projects worth 25% of the grade. Up to 10% extra credit was available through an additional project or PT exam. Overall fairly easy to score very well provided you don't biff more than one project.
Projects focused on web security (similar to InfoSec, JavaScript), network based malware analysis (also similar to InfoSec), Network Monitoring (used Snort and Wireshark) and using ML techniques for anomalous traffic detection (no previous ML experience required, Python).
The slack study group and other students were particularly helpful on Piazza, and the Teaching staff did what they could to help students and generally were responsive and helpful. As is becoming the norm, the Professor was less present as Prof. Lee now has multiple classes running here in OMS as well as the terrestrial requirements at GT. This did not present a problem.
There is no required textbook, but taking InfoSec first is listed as a pseudo requirement. While it will make your life here very very easy to take Info Sec first, you can probably get through it without doing that if you have a CS background and have ever dealt with security in a job.
Overall I would recommend taking the class. Well done, and plays well with other classes (in its current incarnation).`,rating:4,difficulty:2,workload:5},{user:"Georgia Tech Student",reviewDate:"October 31, 2016",semester:"fall 2016",review:`This class consists of 4 assignments, each worth 25% of the total class grade each. As a bonus, there is an optional project and final exam worth 10% each, but only one of them counts towards your grade. There is not currently much reason to watch the lectures exept to prepare for the final exam, however I personally think they may add some tests/quizzes to future runs of the course.
The 4 assignments that are all very different.
The first targets "advanced web security". You write code to exploit a fictitious website and also write a Chrome plugin to guard against certain exploits. I found this assignment quite fun.
The second assignment involves running malware on a VM and examining how it behaves. The entire assignment can probably be done in a single (multi-hour) session. It was quite easy and somewhat interesting.
The third assignment involves writing IPS/IDS rules using snort to classify network traffic as malicious or benign. This asignment was the most difficult for me and it seemed to cause issues for others as well. Writing snort rules was not particularly hard, but the way the assignment was presented was pretty vague. After prodding the TA we were given some, but not enough in my opinion, additional information. In particular, we were asked to write rules "with a long shelf life". There was some comedy here when some of the "benign" traffic that was sampled included browsing an adult e-commerce store. Somebody complained and they issued alternate traffic to analyze for those who were offended.
The last assignment was somewhere between the first and second in terms of effort and required using an ML toolkit to analyze network traffic. Most of the code was provide to us, but it does take some time to figure out how things are setup. The most difficult part of this assignment was implementing an algorithm that was laid out in an academic paper.
This class is a decent option to fill a Computing Systems concentration requirement.`,rating:4,difficulty:2,workload:5}],reviewSummaries:{"fall 2023":"Reviews for the course highlight severe dissatisfaction, with many students expressing frustration over poor instruction and inadequate documentation.
