I highly recommend this course to anyone in OMSCS or OMSA. It will change your understanding of the NLP industry.
Dr. Riedl is in my top 3 favorite OMSCS professors. He takes incredibly complex topics and breaks them into very learnable chunks. He does an incredible job summarizing the evolution of 50 years of NLP research from its origins to the modern day transformer architectures like GPT and BERT.
Many reviews give this a low rating on difficulty. This is mostly because the assignments cover complex concepts and coding frameworks that are already built for you. You are only required to complete a few simple blocks of code that allow the jupyter notebook to run. If you actually spend time walking through the provided code it, it is a way to quickly learn pytorch without too much pain.
What other reviews don't explain - maybe this is new in the summer 2024 class - is that the final project is actually really quite hard. You spent 80% of the semester expecting easy 4-5 hr assignments, but the final project is a 20-40 hr curveball. You are expected to design a KVMNet from scratch. KVMNets are early primitive precursors to the complex general purpose transformers like GPT. You train the KVMNet to answer questions about politicians based on a large Wikipedia dataset.
I didnt realize it until the end, but the KVMNet perfectly combines the principles you learned along the semester and provides a simplified format to understand the pivotal concept that allows GPT to work: attention mechanisms.
My only criticism is an echo of many other reviews in this thread - the lectures provided by Facebook are pretty hard to follow. You spend the first 3/4 of the class expecting best-in-class lectures from Dr Reidl, only to become frustrated at the end of the semester due to the Facebook lecturers reading off slides in broken English. There are some exceptions, I liked the 2 Facebook lecturers who came from GaTech - they seemed to be a bit better at developing educational content.`,rating:5,difficulty:3,workload:10},{user:"QaHiGrgd+Pjfq59R17SqTA==",reviewDate:"December 30, 2023",semester:"fall 2023",review:`The easy reviews are actually CS 7650 OMSCS version of NLP because OMSCentraI doesn't seem to have them (so pls try OMSHub).
ANLP is really a challenging course. Not only you need to learn the nuts and bolts (so please do well in CSE 6040, CDA and one of AI/RL/DL), you are also challenged on timed quizzes and learning how to make GPT.

It is the sort of course that you can get through with a very easy A, but if you want to learn anything you need to invest a little more time.
The class work is basically setting up neural network structures from pictures in the jupyter notebooks. Any background reading on why you’re doing it is outside the required scope. The lectures are barebones, usually 15 minutes per week.
I would say this course is a lightly guided walk through of some of the very basics of NLP. It’s along the lines of the coursera ML course by Andrew Ng where you’ve learned enough to fill in the blanks for some of the ML topics, but not enough that you would have a good idea of how to go about choosing and training and improving a model on a random set of data.
The main criticism:

Needs more comprehensive homework
some better lectures possibly about the application and how to work on the now more difficult homework. The course involves application but very little explanation of why for the application itself
eliminate the parts about non-NN models as that’s been covered in many previous courses.

This class still has some kinks to iron out, such as issues with Gradescope, issues with varied Python code indentations, version compatibility issues in some homeworks.  It is very likely that later semesters will not encounter such issues as the instructors will have already fixed these.
I had minor NLP knowledge before taking this class.  This is my last class in the program so I am already very comfortable with coding, various machine learning techniques, working with arrays (linear algebra) using numpy and pytorch and troubleshooting any potential issues with developing environments.
In terms of difficulty and amount of time invested into the homeworks, it was easy for me.  Each of the 4 homeworks took less than 4 days total for completion.  That time includes some hours spent training models on my laptop CPU and cancelling/restarting the job to walk away due to irl interruptions (since I was stubborn and did not want to use Google's Colab).
The homework difficulty progression is like this: 1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3.  Minimum time to completion: 4 hrs.  Maximum time to completion: 4 days.
The lectures in this class are very terse however they do provide the necessary citations/resources for students to dig deeper if they are so inclined.  No doubt some reviews will say that this class is thin on materials but I would disagree, since there are excess time left from completing the homeworks, I was able to spend them exploring further into the subject topics based on the provided resources.
The reviews for this class will likely be polar, on the one hand there will be lots of reviews on how thin the materials are or how easy it is, on the other hand there will likely be lots of reviews on the difficulty with Gradescope, version incompatibility issues, pytorch, lack of troubleshooting support etc...
Do keep in mind that this is a graduate level course and there is a base level expectation of being able to troubleshoot and solve problems on your own with minimal hand-holding.  Additionally, how much one gets out of the class depends on the level of comfort with the aforementioned subjects.  If all the time is spent troubleshooting the shape and rotation of a matrix multiplication problem or on basic python stuffs such as list of lists or list of dicts then there will be less time and brain resources devoted into exploring the actual NLP topics.
Therefore it is my opinion that to get the most out of this class, you have to already be comfortable with basic linear algebra, basic ML techniques, numpy (and therefore its big brother pytorch), scikit-learn, and know-how to set up and troubleshoot your python development environments.`,rating:5,difficulty:1,workload:8},{user:"ldL1rAba1upqXWpFfRCqJw==",reviewDate:"August 14, 2023",semester:"summer 2023",review:`Good course that introduces foundational NLP material.  Covers methods of prepping text data for modeling as well as modeling techniques & architectures used for NLP problems.
The most difficult part of the class was implementing models using pytorch. I had no experience with pytorch coming into the class but was able to figure it out via online research. Other than that, the class wasn't too difficult. 9 hours/week workload really only applies to weeks when homework was due. Other weeks it was closer to 5 hours.
I thoroughly enjoyed this class. It's a great class to wrap up the OMSA/OMSCS program because it's not too demanding and it applies much of what you learn in other courses. Would recommend for anyone interested in NLP.`,rating:4,difficulty:3,workload:9}],reviewSummaries:{"summer 2024":"The course offers valuable insights into the NLP industry, with Dr. Riedl praised for effectively simplifying complex topics and providing a comprehensive overview of NLP's evolution. Many students appreciate the manageable assignments that facilitate learning PyTorch, though some note that the final project can be unexpectedly demanding, requiring 20-40 hours of work to design a KVMNet from scratch. This project is seen as a significant integration of the semester's concepts, particularly attention mechanisms. Conversely, students express frustration with the quality of lectures provided by Facebook, finding them difficult to follow compared to Dr. Riedl's engaging teaching style. A few Facebook lecturers are recognized for their better educational delivery, but overall, the inconsistent quality detracts from the learning experience.","fall 2023":"The ANLP course is described as both challenging and rewarding, requiring a solid foundation in prior courses like CSE 6040 and CDA. Students must navigate timed quizzes and learn to build ChatGPT from scratch, which significantly increases the difficulty level. Despite the tough workload, many find the course to be one of the most exciting offerings in the OMSA program, emphasizing the rewards that come from mastering the complex material. The course's demanding nature may deter some, but those willing to put in the effort often enjoy the experience and valuable skills gained.","spring 2023":"The course on Natural Language Processing (NLP) received mixed reviews. Many students appreciated its straightforward and accessible content, highlighting that it effectively introduces foundational concepts suitable for beginners. However, some reviewers criticized it for being overly simplistic and lacking depth, particularly for a graduate program. They felt it did not adequately challenge students or provide advanced knowledge necessary for further study or professional application. Overall, while the course is ideal for newcomers to the field, those seeking a rigorous academic experience may find it insufficient.","summer 2023":"The course offers foundational knowledge in natural language processing (NLP) and is beneficial for enhancing resumes, but it comes with mixed reviews. While many students find it easy to complete, especially with prior coding experience, others criticize its lack of depth and comprehensive homework. Lectures are brief and mostly guide students in practical applications without adequate theoretical background. Technical issues with Gradescope and version compatibility also detract from the experience. Despite these drawbacks, motivated students appreciate the opportunity to explore NLP topics independently. Overall, the course serves as a manageable finish for graduate programs, especially for those already familiar with machine learning and programming."}};export{e as default};
