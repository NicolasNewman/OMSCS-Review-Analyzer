Here's the rub, though - it actually has something important to say, and I would recommend that anyone in the ML specialty take this course. Specifically, this course teaches one thing: the bias/variance tradeoff can have dire, real-world consequences, and you need to think about how to navigate this tradeoff, or change your models so that you modify how bias is shaped.
In a vacuum, this seems like a really straightforward statement, but when you're inundated with tons of bad statistics, bad applications of data, bad applications of models, and bad modeling in general, it makes you reconsider your approach.
Similar to how ML4T is not really about trading, this class isn't really about ethics, but rather how ML models can be difficult to wrangle even in the best of circumstances, and being a good technologist/data scientist means understanding the nuances of the real-world implications of your models.
So, yeah, it's easy, but the core of the idea of the course is really important, and lesson really only becomes clear after you've been beaten over the head with it a number of times.`,rating:4,difficulty:1,workload:9},{user:"y6xgZdnX5shQuDopNlh0iw==",reviewDate:"July 7, 2024",semester:"spring 2024",review:`I strongly don't recommend this class. Most people (including me) take it because it's an easy class with a somewhat interesting subject area and makes for an easy semester/combo. That's correct, but I strongly underestimated the amount of bullshit assignments and the general bottom of the barrel quality of lectures here. If you'd like to learn about AI Ethics, read Weapons of Math Destruction by Cathy O'Niel. It's an interesting airplane read type of book that still covers all the topics at more depth than this entire course's lectures. And you can skip a bunch of bullshit assignments making graphs, writing a paragraph, and then repeating 15 times for blatantly obvious things.

First, if you know Python going into this course, the assignment generally take only a few hours per week.  Most of the material is intuitive if you have some general common sense (as in: do you think exploiting peoples' data is a good idea or bad idea?).
The grading is very relaxed, and so long as you complete everything being asked this is fairly light course.
Now the not so great: are the assignments fully obvious in what the deliverables are?  For an unbelievable number of people in the class, it appears that the answer is consistently a resounding "No!".  I don't understand, as it feels pretty straightforward what is being asked; yet, such an opinion evidently puts me in the minority.  Or maybe people just enjoy arguing over pedantic details.  But nothing has been so overwhelmingly confounding that achieving an A is unobtainable, in my opinion.
Some assignments do tend to feel redundant and arbitrary, but with some basic Python scripting most things are not particularly complex. Yes, there's writing, and yes, this class relies on JDF (use LaTeX!).  But there often are no page limits (looking at you HCI or ML, etc.).  So the added stress of needing to edit down a document is non-existent here.
My final comment is that I wish all assignments released earlier; as it is, things are time released seemingly arbitrarily causing me to sometimes spend days with nothing going on.  This gives a shocking amount of time to spare, which may be a pleasant reprieve from other OMSCS courses.  So work ahead as far as you can; it's not a big time commitment---just prepared to be on standby until the next batch of tasks become available.

The assignments are very straightforward and the tests are fairly easy if you just watch the lectures.  Now, some of the material is indeed worth discussing/interesting such as the laws and ethical considerations surrounding deployment of ML/AI.  They also introduce you to some actual software tools and methods to mitigate bias and encourage you to think about the trade-offs when using these algorithms and what 'fair/unbiased' even means in some contexts.
I don't necessarily have a problem with a class being easy, my main gripe with this class is that some of the assignments/tests just seem poorly constructed.  There were some questions that were clearly just asking the wrong thing or confused about the thing it was asking us to implement.  Other questions were clearly going to return useless results, but the instructions from TA's were to just do it anyway and report those useless results.  These questions should probably just be removed/edited?  I felt that the intro stats material should just be made optional and dig more deeply into the bias/fairness techniques or something like model transparency/explainability.  The final felt like a repeat of the final project, just a report of going through a use case of doing bias mitigation.
I'll contrast this with another class which I would also consider pretty easy (though I'd say slightly harder), but for which I gave a great rating:  CS7632 Game AI.  The assignments in that class are extremely well designed and incredibly fun, I actually cared about putting extra work in even though I didn't need to since the assignments were engaging instead of some....thing....that I would get out of the way in this class.

Instead it touches on issues that are likely to be hit as a team lead or manager in any regulated field, and more broadly any software that affects the public.
The course is fundamentally structured around US law.  Professional Engineers have a legal obligation to consider the health and welfare of the public, and while most CS grads won't get a PE license it is still important for management and team leadership to consider the impact of work on society - even if you don't personally care about ethical behavior, the legal ramifications of getting these things wrong could land you and/or your employer in jeopardy.
Having taken engineering ethics at an engineering school, this is a well-designed computer science equivalent: an ethics class that introduces you to the legal and ethical issues that you are likely to face while you are developing computing, AI, ML solutions.  I have run into some of these in real life, and it will be nice to have the legal background as a buffer / correction to my general inclination.

This class has merit. A lot of people here hate on this class, but it has a great purpose. It is an excellent introduction to AI, Stats, and Data Analysis using Python. If you've not done any of these before, it's a great chance to learn.
A lot of the criticism seems to come from right wing leaning people who are afraid the course is 'woke'. I don't think that's fair. Statistically, this class is showing when AI is biased and when it is not. Certainly many of the datasets we analyzed were not biased, and some were. If you want to approach subjects like race in an intelligent way, this class will give you the tools.
The fact that some of the datasets don't show any bias or even any statisctical pattern leads to my one critique. It can be frustrating to compute figures that are meaningless. Or graph outcomes that don't follow any pattern. Do not let that discourage you. Just report the results and let them be. That's how real data works. You're not going to get a bad grade because you don't find bias. Sometimes it's not there.
The assignments are sometimes a little ambiguous, but the TAs will clarify in Ed Discussion. I'm sure the TAs hate answering the same questions over again, and the course could benefit from updating the assignments a little bit.`,rating:4,difficulty:2,workload:4},{user:"n70rALB3Re1J2WuKho9B4A==",reviewDate:"February 28, 2024",semester:"fall 2023",review:`My last and worst class in OMSCS.

Instead this is a semester long course, so tons of repetitions just to fill up the time.
This class could've easily won the most tedious assignments award in my entire academic life. The assignments all exhibit an awful pattern of high volume of low value work. For example, in one of the so-called AI/ML assignments, students are asked to calculate mean and standard deviation for a dataset, copy that into a report and format, calculate those for 10% of data, calculate those for 60% of data. Repeat for a protected class, and repeat for all subgroups in the protected class. The calculation in Python is effortless, the time is spent on copying and formatting ~30 sets of values in the report. No one checks the result as long as some numbers are there. Data analysis is minimal, as long as you wrote two sentences.

It gives a good intro to industry problems and stresses the importance of finding solutions. But, it gets kinda unbearable real quick. The reason for this becomes clear at the end of the course – there's simply not enough material to fill a whole semester with relevant topics.
So, what happens is that throughout the course, you deal with tedious calculations and engage in writing that, while intended to represent your opinion, often earns fewer points because you summarize banal concepts in a sentence and not 5. The same situation arises during the midterm, where you encounter questions like 'Do you think this graph is misleading? Why?' Surprisingly, you can actually give a wrong answer for it. The final presents an additional challenge with numerous criteria for the artifact you need to find. This leaves you with no other option but to rely on synthetic data with no real-life relevance.
The projects' instructions lack clarity, the staff responds to questions but often very late. That actually doesn’t make them fix the document. Because why bother when you can leave every student frustrated and allow each TA to decide individually how to assess the homework?
Too much time is spent on topics that shouldn't be part of this course, such as delving into the basics of AI and ML just to 'pad' the syllabus. Meanwhile, a mere 25% of the material focuses on the practical techniques for addressing the core issues. Even this content relies heavily on open-source libraries that are hardly maintained, or projects developed and supported by Google(...?).
In summary, The course manages to convey the importance of the subject but fails to encourage doing research due to exercises that lack depth. In my view, this material is better to be integrated at a basic level into any course touching upon AI/ML. The other option is to make it available to non-CS students only.

The megathreads for each assignment is posted by the TA several weeks in advance of the due date, with a FAQs PDF.
There are two exams. The first exam is an actual exam. I did not do any of the readings or look at the lecture slides, but still got a perfect score. The second exam is more of an assignment, and it is untimed. At the time of writing, I did not get my score back yet, but by that point I only need a 20% for an A.

This course is my final course in the program, and it looks like I saved the worst for last. I got an easy A in the course, but it was so frustrating and made me dumber. This course is taught at a middle school level with really basic material like mean, median, and mode….seriously?! In a graduate course? And then at other times they’ll get you to do actually bad math like averaging categories (ex - convert this category to 1, this one to 2, this one to 3….now do some math with that like averaging / correlation?). That’s nonsensical and embarrassing anyone signed off on it.
The assignments are poorly written, and you’ll spend more time trying to figure out what they expect rather than actually doing the assignment. Yet there are no office hours, so you’ll post something to Ed and wait for staff to respond. Sometimes that can take days. And then the assignment is really basic like calculating a bunch of values and then putting them in a bulleted list. Oh, but make sure to use JDF because we’re going to pretend like it’s a hard assignment!
The course doesn’t take much time, and you could pair it with another course easily. You can finish all of the lectures in the first month of the course.

If the answer is fixed, why not make it multiple choice?
There will be many weeks where you will spend less than an hour of work. When assignments become due, you will spend a decent chunk of time doing them. Not because the assignments are hard, but because the writeups are unorganized and ambiguous.
The Ed Discussions were regularly filled with students asking for clarifications for each step of each assignment, so you're constantly piecing together what has been said in the Ed Discussions threads with the assignment writeup to find out what exactly you need to do. In my opinion, that level of confusion would mean its time to revise the write up.
The assignments involve lots of data massaging, and showing data in different ways. Again, it is not hard. I used Python, Grafana & Postgres SQL for all of the assignments to make them easier. They were all  different variations of the same problems.

Assessments: Assignments, Weekly Discussions, Final Project, Mid Term (MCQs, Fill in the blanks, T/F), and a final take-home exam (similar to final project)
Pros: It's an easy A course if you do all the required stuff. The lectures are good (but you might not need them to complete the course because every assignment except the final exam is so basic). Good to pair with a harder course if you want to graduate early, but otherwise, not worth the amount you pay for it.
Cons: Each and every assignment is poorly written. You need to ask a lot of questions and search Ed Discussions to really understand the assignment requirements. TAs grade your assignment manually, so your score really depends on the TA who is grading you. Some TAs would cut marks for really basic stuff. For eg, if you write that the random variables are x, y,and z, instead of writing there are three random variables, you will lose points.

In this course, you will absolutely write more papers than code. If your goal is to supplement your 1337-HAX0RR BIG DATA skills or even learn more about industry tooling in that space, you would be sorely disappointed; this isn't the class for that.
On the other hand: if you want a simple course with a light workload to wrap up OMSCS with and/or know more about how to ethically work with and review large data sets, this is a fine course. You could also pair this with another simple or medium difficulty (think 3.5~4 rating on OMSCentral) and not struggle as long as you have good time management. I work full-time, have two kids in school, am taking two courses this Fall, and have been able to keep up with both. Currently have an A in my other course and will likely pass this one with a high B or "low" A (narrowly missing "high" A because I f'd up on two high-weight assignments).
The class discussions/exercises are simple and can be completed within 15~30mins. Write-up/critique prompts are straightforward but you will want to be detailed to ensure you're meeting requirements. The projects are simple but TEDIOUS and ANNOYING. I won't reiterate what others have said but I will confirm at least that part of all the complaints is certainly true.
Mid-term exam is OK. I only partially watched some lectures and managed to get by with a low B. I'll perhaps try a bit more for the final.
My only complaint is about how opaque the grading is for the project assignments (which, altogether, account for 40% of your grade). While the assignments are absolutely on the easy side, they are also tedious and long-winded; you will definitely lose out on points if you mess around or skip reading the assignment FAQs; no rubrics are provided, you simply have to follow the instructions and hope for the best.

Coursework

Class Discussion/Exercises (15%, 12 at 5 points each): These consisted of Case Studies and Exercises.  Case studies were categorized as a discussion post to which you had to answer a couple of questions and reply to at least 1 other student's reply.  The Exercises were essentially the same thing, but it didn't require a response to other students.  There were 6 case studies and 6 exercises.
Projects (40%, 5 at 100 points each): These consisted of a lot of data analysis, interpretation, and plotting.  If you know Python pandas, this will help you a lot, but it can be done with Excel as well.  Biggest deliverable is a PDF report in JDF format.  Project 1 analyzes advertiser information from a selected social media platform.  Project 2 has you pick a dataset and perform a lot of statistical analysis.  Project 3 (AI/ML Part 1) has you explore relationships, correlation, means, and standard deviations of a given dataset.  Project 4 (AI/ML Part 2) has you use Python to analyze a similarity score between words as well as suggested answers to an analogy.  Project 5 has you "look at the impact of computing and applying fairness metrics to "fix" data that could be used to train algorithms associated with learning from credit-based data sets."
Mid-Term Exam (10%, 78 possible points): This exam covered modules 1-8.  It was open notes and open books.  You could also use the lecture slides and transcripts.  The notes could be physical or accessed on your computer.  It is proctored through Honorlock.  You have 120 minutes to take the exam consisting of about 27 questions.
Final Exam (10%, 100 possible points):  Calling this an exam is far from the what most perceive as an exam. Very little comes from the modules after module 8.  This involved finding an "artifact" released within the last 6 months and doing a report on it, answering questions in 4 various tasks.  The artifact also had to have some form of data evidence (research publication, dataset, survey results, etc.) which could be used in answering and justifying your responses.  Most of the time was spent on finding the article to meet the criteria.  The article I found was somewhat interesting, but I did not learn much from it overall.
Final Project (15%, 100 possible points): This could be worked on by yourself or as part of a team of up to 4 students.  This applies lessons/tasks performed in all the previous projects, assignments, and lectures.  This includes graphs, predictions, bias, and fairness metrics.  You have to submit a PDF report in JDF format as well as a Jupyter notebook.  This involved finding a dataset meeting a set of criteria, analyzing the data, answering various questions, try to mitigate bias/fairness, and analyze the results.
Written Critiques (10%, 40 points for one, 65 points for one): These consisted of taking a topic, doing some research, apply some thought, and writing about it.  The EAV (Ethical Autonomous Vehicle) had you analyze what an autonomous vehicle might do in a given situation and answer an array of questions about it.  The What-If Tool had you run a COMPAS demo and answer an array of questions about it.  Both had a deliverable in thge form of a report submitted as a PDF in JDF format limited to 3 pages max.

Take-Aways

Miscellaneous Stuff: I feel there is a lot of busy work, which is a pretty much waste of time (time filler).  Extract data, run some calculations on it.  Do some interpretation into protected classes.  Plot some charts.  Analyze those charts.  Put all your analysis in the reports.  While it could be interesting, most of the work felt like busy work.  When it came to the assignments, there is A LOT of vagueness in the specification... to the extent you may spend more time looking through posts or asking questions on Ed than you will spend actually on the assignments.  They re-used a dataset from previous semesters, and there is an issue with some data being split across two lines.  Instead of fixing it for future terms, you have to ask about it, to which you will be told you can consolidate (fix) the lines.  Not taking these 2 minutes to fix the dataset shows their attention and effort to the class.
Quizzes: Other than the mid-term, there really aren't any "quizzes".
Lectures: The lectures were pretty decent and able to keep my attention.  I feel they could use a little work and some definite updating.  You have to watch (mark as done) the Welcome and Course Information modules in order for other lessons to unlock.  And, yes, you will have people complain on Ed that they can't access assignments or lectures because they haven't watched these modules.  Most of the modules after 8 are not so important.  Some of the modules may mention multiple points but only focus on a couple.
Textbook: The book listed as required for this course is Weapons of Math Destruction by Cathy O'Neil, 2016 edition, ISBN 978-0-553-41883-5.  I personally never read or opened the book.  Someone was able to find the book for free through the GATech online library, so dig around for it before purchasing it.
Case Studies & Exercises: These were more of a time waste than anything.  Here is a topic.  Answer these couple of questions.  Reply with a reasonable response to other students, showing some thought.
Exams:  The mid-term exam seemed really fair, especially when you are allowed to use PDFs of the lectures, the transcripts from the lectures, and any notes you may have taken.  As for the "final exam," it was sort of a joke, but at the same time, it was a huge pain trying to find an article which met all the criteria set forth in the spec.
Professor and TAs: The entire teaching staff was great.  The TAs have a very obvious present in Ed.  They were respectable and responded in a decent time.  The professor (Dr. Mandala) was never present, so the TAs basically ran the class.
Grading: The TAs try to get grades released in about 2 weeks or less, but given the number of students and the condensed summer term, it has taken a little bit longer.  Mid-term grades were released around 2 am on the last day a student could withdraw from the course.
Overall Grade: In the end, my final grade was a 97.83, which got me an A.

TLDR
I started off in the course very strong, but due to an unexpected medical emergency, I ended up getting a little behind on the lectures.  As a result, I found myself pulling a few late night weekends working on the homework assignments and case studies.  In the end, I withdrew from the Spring 2023 course because my health was more important.
I decided to take this course over the Summer of 2023, which was a good decision.  Overall, it is an easy course.  It doesn't take too much effort.  Just do the assignments and meet the ask in the specs, since they do not provide any rubrics.  Do this, and you should be able to pass easily with an A.  There is a lot of busy work.  The assignment specs are very, very vague (again, more time spent on Ed asking questions or searching for answers than doing the actual assignemtn).  The final exam is a pain in the rear and one of my least favorite parts of the course.  As others have said, don't expect to gain much knowledge from this class because I didn't, other than what protected classes were.  It would definitely be an easy course which could be coupled with another easy course during a Spring or Fall semester.`,rating:3,difficulty:2,workload:12},{user:"HwZl5jbJAbv27ayeH8bCVg==",reviewDate:"July 18, 2023",semester:"spring 2023",review:"I used to briefly be an attorney working on civil rights cases.

I got flashbacks to high school busy work assignments. You will spend 6-8 hours on a project on mean, median, and modes. The projects are tangentially related to AI Ethics. The assignments are completely straightforward and easy, but you will spend half the time trying to decipher the question. There will be multiple questions asking the same thing in different words, but you will have to create many redundant Ed discussion questions to make sure of this (rather than the instructors editing the prompt). You will spend maybe 5% of each assignment actually thinking about AI Ethics, the rest is formatting your answer.
For one of the assignments, the prompt asks you to display information on 50 different words, each of which has multiple words associated with it. I did exactly this in table format, and of course table was huge, because there is literally no way to display this much information otherwise. They took off 2 points because the table was "barely readable". Lol. Not like I really care, because I got a 98 on the assignment anyways, but really? Why even take points off at that point? I don't even think the graders read the submissions fully.
The single most frustrating class I've ever taken across any of my academic experience. I was looking for an easy A and it was really not even worth it. You will spend just as much time as other classes, and get nothing from it, because your time was spent formatting results in a huge table. Then they will take points off because you did as they asked but they don't like how it looks.
It makes me feel a bit bad to leave such a negative review, because everyone working the course is very nice, but this class is truly appalling and is what prompted me to finally leave a review here.

My advice: pair this class with another harder class and just coast to get a B. If you're intent on getting an A, it'll be easy but you're going to get frustrated by the quality of the assignments.
Alternatively, get a B by doing the simple projects and critiques and just completely skip the final project and exams because they suck.
It's frustrating because the intersection of AI and ethics is really interesting and you see those bright spots sometimes but then then those sparks are snuffed out by a course that seemingly the instructor doesn't even care about.
Pros:


Exposes you to Jupyter, Pandas, and NumPy, which I have never used before. Even so, I was easily able to complete the assignments.


Exams are really simple. Midterm is a Canvas-based exam where as the final is more a "practical" take-home exam.


Grading is pretty lenient and TAs are nice


Cons:


Assignments are uninspired, boring, and descriptions are awfully vague.

Sometimes I will leave portions of assignments half-finished on purpose if I do not believe I need that portion for my grade. I would often still get marks for it.
The lectures are fine and I enjoyed them quite a bit. The assignments on the other hand are pure tedium - I’ve had less than 200 lines of code be used for a 15+ page reports due to the copy and pasting of the code or plugging in of different values. The assignment instructions are vague, have grammatical errors, and required constant TA adjustment during the semester.

I had taken a similar AI Ethics course at my undergraduate institution that covered a lot of the big themes of the subject (algorithmic bias, major case studies, the role of the government/tech industry, etc.) and I felt like this course regurgitated a lot of that with little unique insight.
The short writing assignments were very simple and I don't recall them being graded stringently at all. Every "programming" assignment that relates to manipulating datasets or using ML models to test for bias can be completed using Google Sheets/Excel formulas, except for the final project, which is slightly more involved.

technologists because of this misuse would override the potential benefits that AI could have for society.

to fix the problem. She wonders if she should just give up and take those offered jobs in corporate
management, which actually pays much better with less worries.

Three of the project homework assignments were basically the same. Midterm was really simple (just general understanding of the ppt charts). Class discussions and written critiques were just follow the rubric.
Everything was just follow the rubric. I do not even know if they really looked at the answers and how you got them. I thought I bombed the final project and the final. I was over the class and was OK if I got a B (which with getting close to a zero on each I would have had). I got 100% on both .

I admit that sometimes this course is technically easy, but ethics is not about solving a difficult mathematical problem, but about the impact it gives to the lives of thousands of people. Throughout this course, I could see students giving simple answers without elaboration, and reaching conclusions without justifications. I think that is why students think the course is easy.
Being a student, if you insist enough to provide justifications on every judgement, then your answer on each ethical decision should be in much greater details then the other casual students. I think that is the attitude that we should possess, when we make design decisions that affects different races or genders or countries of origin. (I have worked in government, and bureaucracy requires detailed justifications on every step along the way to reaching a system design for the general public.)
Incidents on Facebook (target advertising that excludes a certain race), COVID vaccine passports, ArriveCAN that uses data analytics or even prediction models to trace the tested-positive or unaccented , China face recognition system and COVID health codes, nation-wide surveillance... These are systems that greatly affect or even control our lives. These systems would become better (or cease to exist) if every system designer or developer knows the AI ethics good enough, and are bold enough to do the "ethical" thing. In additions, political issues such as LGBTQ+ and race induced debiasing (which is usually supported by "left wing" or Democrats), while over-debiasing may become an issue if a heterosexual white man is being discriminated instead (which is usually a concern by "right wing" or Republicans). I think a balanced discussion with supportive evidence would be great answers to many homework and projects in this course.
Overall, I think this course introduces a lot of topics that we can further drill on, incl. protected classes (race, sex, country of origin, etc.), laws, cheating with statistics, aif360, Google what-if, and other contemporary issues.

I was in the middle of a job change, moving from one state to another and took this along with INTA-6450 ( Data analytics and Security). This was an easy pair except for the week i was traveling. I was  able to work ahead in AIES and finish the assignments to get some time for my move.
The assignments were easy to finish but gave a lot of learning to me since i am new to pandas and Scikit-learn. It seemed like a lot of unnecessary work plotting 20 graphs with different combinations and writing reports. This class is a good introduction to the data analytics and provides exposure to jupyter, pandas, matplotlib, and makes you familiar with handling/manipulating data and displaying graphs. For some of the assignments, instructions were not very clear, so there were lots of piazza threads asking for clarity. Vijay from the TA team was very active and helpful in responding to all the queries.
The mid term exam was a mess for me because of honorlock issue that kept blocking me from opening any document on my laptop even though the exam was open book. I did score around the median and was able to get 90+ in overall.
The final exam was just about picking up an article related to AI ethics and write a report about it with the supporting data. The difficult part was finding a recent article/video published within last 6 months that had enough supporting data reference in it. Once you find the suitable article, it was pretty easy to write the paper.
Final Project was a group project  (group of 4) where i struggled a bit because most of the group members were absent due to personal and professional reasons. Thanksgiving was also one of the reasons our group couldn't meet.
Most of the team members were more comfortable working with Excel and didn't want to use python for the project unless it became absolutely necessary. I had to do most of the coding 1 day prior to submission for the steps where we needed  to submit the code. Most frustrating part was someone in the group asking : why we used certain function/method at the last moment when we didn't had time.
So if you get a good group, the final project should be easy-peasy. The grading on final exam and project was very lenient.
Last week of the semester was little busy with final project, final exam , critique and discussion all pending around the same time.

As others mentioned, the course itself is easy when compared to other courses in the OMSCS program. However, easy is subjective. The course is easy for those already experienced in Python / Pandas, etc. but it may be challenging to those who lack experience with Jupyter Notebooks.
While I did have experience in Python, this was my first time deep diving into Python for Data Science. By starting assignments early and watching tutorials on the side, I found the homework to be very easy. However, it is time-consuming. My advice is to start early and don't leave your homework for the last-minute.
My only complaint about the entire course is the way the instructors wrote the assignment instructions. I found that I often spent a lot more time trying to decipher what the instructions were asking for than actually working on the assignment itself. I found that classmates experienced the same issue and would post for clarification on Piazza. If a clarification in Piazza was made, the instructions were never updated to reflect that clarification. Because of this, I had to skim through many posts to ensure I'm completing the assignment correctly.
Anyways, the class is also composed of discussions which are very easy. It's just a matter of answering the prompt and responding to two other classmates. The midterm was open notes and consisted of a mix of multiple choice and write-in questions. I felt that there were trick questions but received a passing grade either way. The final exam was converted into a take-home essay that had its challenges but it wasn't difficult. I felt that the grading was more than fair. I received perfect scores in all assignments minus the midterm. I am in no way an expert in Pandas but this course is definitely do-able as a beginner.

I think a lot of student questions were due to a bit of ambiguity in the assignment descriptions, so maybe they could look into improving those.
I gave this course a "Dislike" because the only thing we've covered all semester is "Protected Classes". Protected Classes are features in a dataset like race, age, sex, etc. You don't want to build an AI that incorporates historical biases due to an unbalanced distribution of such features.

I do think it's possible to expand the breadth of topics covered in the class while keeping it brief and engaging, but it would need to be overhauled.
The lectures are pretty good. Prof. Howard picked rather relevant examples of AI ethics issues. I thought they were well structured and clear.
There are only about 5 coding assignments. I think they took me about 5-6 hours each (but I have 3 hours/week since other weeks were just discussions on the class forum, which were ~30mins to do). The assignments are more tedious than difficult (little things like formatting tables, copying and pasting text, etc. take up the most time). They kinda felt like busy work.

The class is certainly very easy, and as others have mentioned, I wish that it actually delved deeper into either how to apply AI/ML techniques, or how the bias mitigation techniques work. I think that a lot of the concepts covered could have been condensed. The midterm and final exam project were both very easy, and this class did change my perspective and make me very cognizant of how AI can negatively impact certain groups. The projects were tedious and didn't necessarily equate to a lot of learning, but still, the workload for this class was extremely light (which I wanted).
You don't put too much into this class, but you don't get too much out of the class. If you are looking for an easy class to pair with another class (plus I heard it might be an ML specialization elective now?), you will be satisfied, but you don't learn that much, so I am a bit neutral overall.

This was without a doubt the easiest class I've taken by far. I feel that the first half of the material could have been compressed a lot more so as to leave more time to deep dive into the various bias mitigation strategies. As it is, after the class I still have only an extremely surface-level understanding of the different ways to mitigate bias, which is much less than I expected out of a graduate-level class from Georgia Tech. For example, there was an exercise where we discussed bias in word embeddings, but didn't learn about how exactly to reduce bias in these word embeddings.
I would have liked this class much better if there were lectures that explained the inner workings of bias mitigation algorithms and assignments that made us implement some of these algorithms from scratch, or at least tested our understanding of how they work.`,rating:3,difficulty:1,workload:5},{user:"Georgia Tech Student",reviewDate:"December 6, 2020",semester:"fall 2020",review:`I think you're going to get out of this class what you're going to put in.

You'll probably want to come into this class with some proficiency with Python/Jupyter Notebook. You can get away with just using Excel for the first two assignments, but over time you're going to have to be doing a lot of stuff that will need Sci-Kit, Numpy, and Pandas. The last two assignments also require you to reverse engineer/understand some Python libraries from IBM and Google for helping combat bias in ML algorithms.
In any case, I think you can probably do the bare minimum and spend a very small amount of time in the class and still do well in the course. However, if you pour a lot of time into doing things well in the course, it's rather rewarding.

TL;DR The difficulty of this class is on par with a high school course, and falls short of meaningful discussions into biases of AI/ML.
I really wanted to like this class. It has so much potential with its content being incredibly relevant, modern, and of huge impact. Unfortunately it doesn't deliver and will leave you simply saying "There is a problem with bias in AI (hopefully not new information to you), but I don't know what is being done in industry to address it." The final project very lightly touches on bias mitigation techniques, but you'll mostly just call library functions without understanding how the bias is mitigated. In its current standing this course feels like it should be offered in a MBA program, not a graduate-level CS program due to its shallowness.
Pros

Minimal time required Of the 8 classes I've completed, this course has by far and away required the least amount of time. I have been able to knock out the lectures and weekly deliverables on Monday night. I've been able to complete each project in a single session on a weekend afternoon.
Active instructional team The TAs do an excellent job of answering every Piazza question. Professor Howard participates as well, answering questions and occasionally posting articles to generate discussion.
Easy If you're looking for an easy course, I don't think OMSCS gets easier than this. I have a 100 so far, including a midterm exam. The work required for this course is incredibly easy to complete, as evidenced by the very high assignment averages.

Cons

Pace The course drags its feet on content that could be covered in a fraction of the time. Time is spent covering middle school-level descriptive statistics like mean, median, mode. You will complete multiple projects that simply process data and report descriptive and inferential statistics. To me this felt like Week 1 - 2 type material, but instead it took us all the way through the midterm. I wish this course spent time understanding the math and theory behind defining fairness and mitigating bias, but it gets brushed over in the last two weeks of the course in the final project.
Lack of Meaningful Discussion Most weeks we are required to write a response to a case study or writing prompt covering some ethical concern. Part of the assignment usually requires you to respond to 2 classmates. The problem is that there is no incentive to engage in thoughtful conversation. Most responses are along the lines of "that's a really good point" or "i agree with what you said about X." Additionally, there is one discussion board for the entire class, so it gets extremely cluttered and infeasible to keep up with.
Easy This can be a pro if you're looking to double up courses in a semester, but if you're wanting to be challenged in understanding bias and bias mitigation techniques in AI or to be pushed into evaluating ethical concerns at a deep level, you'll be left unsatisfied. I remember the exact assignment where I stopped trying for this course. We were discussing bias in NLP, and were provided a research paper from Microsoft about addressing the biases. After reading it, studying it, and posting my thoughts in my weekly response, the only responses I received were "yeah ok kewl research but the devs need to watch out for their own biases." face palm Based on my observations of Piazza, this course attracts the weakest OMSCS students who post questions like, "When the instructions say X, I just want to confirm that I should do X?" So it's best to just ignore Piazza unless you have a specific question.
Projects The projects are mostly just following a step-by-step series of instructions. I just completed the current project covering word vectors while watching a football game. It's "do this" followed by "do that." There isn't much thinking involved. The projects don't push you to understand why things work the way they do.
Supporting Materials Like I mentioned earlier, sometimes papers will be listed as an optional reference, but you won't actually need to read them for this course. There is a great text listed on the syllabus, Weapons of Math Destruction, but it's never referenced in the course which is a missed opportunity.

Overall, this course is pretty easy. The workload is low in the beginning and increases in the last ~4 weeks of the semester. The ideas presented in lecture are easy to grasp and not too technical. The lectures touch on general questions about ethics for AI, AI-related scandals that have been in the news over the last few years, and focuses heavily on bias in algorithms. The more substantial assignments are all in python and focus on mitigating bias in datasets and algorithms, with a major focus on protected classes (race, sex, etc.) The projects are interesting from a data science perspective, and I would say that this course would be good to have for ethical purposes for students who plan to work with AI/ML. However, I would say that this course does not gain you any deep understanding about AI, ML, or algorithms. If you are looking for a prep course for AI or ML, this is not it.

I also enjoyed exploring the AIF360 APIs to detect bias via various metrics (Confusion Matrix, Disparate Impact, Statistical Parity, etc) and mitigation techniques (Adversial debasing, Reweighing, Disparate impact remover, etc).
Additionally, the class provided a good intro to descriptive (frequency, standard_dev, mean, mode, variance, correlation, five number summary, etc) and inferential statistics (randomized sampling techniques, Simpson's paradox, etc) concepts.  We explored bias and fairness topics such as China's social credit system, or the bias in word embeddings (using word2vec python module), or the bias in the underlying facial recognition libraries.
The recommended text book is Weapons of Math Destruction. Although the text book was not directly used in the lectures or exams, it's a very good book to read to get more insights. The instructor, Professor Howard is very engaged and a really awesome person to interact with. The class lectures are of high quality. The TA team especially Vijay, Jeanette, Bryan were all very helpful. Vijay answered all piazza responses in a record time and was very patient in his responses. The most challenging part for me was the lack of clarity in assignment directions. I think that's because we are more used to having "correct/incorrect" answers in assignments instead of exploring questions that are more abstract where there is no clear right or wrong answer.

AI Ethics was brand-new this semester. While I haven't been actively reviewing things in the past, I felt it's important that folks be given an impression of this class. A lot of people have been asking, so I'll try and make this somewhat detailed and go into specifics where possible. I've completed 8 courses in OMSCS as of this writing as well as my undergrad at GT, for reference.
Take this review with a grain of salt; throughout the semester, the teaching team made adjustments to the course based on feedback from students and also implemented some changes given the COVID-19 situation. This flexibility, in general, is a good thing, and it's encouraging to see the teaching staff being responsive and making some needed changes. However, it does mean that my review may not be fully accurate to the course as it continues to adapt; I can only speak to my experience.
I'll start off with good/bad highlights and get into more specifics below.
The Good


Content was topically relevant. Students were encouraged to read material from ongoing ethics issues, recent news stories, and thought-experiments relevant to today. The material is definitely not abstract/theoretical.


Course doesn't assume a strong programming / AI background and could therefore serve as a gentle introduction to these topics for folks who are newer.


Students get exposure to some real examples of algorithmic bias and can see how marginalized groups can be negatively impacted, even in the absence of malicious intent.


The Bad


Theoretical depth is lacking. Initial assignments are just reporting basic metrics using python/pandas and the later ones rely on third-party libraries which aren't explored from an implementation perspective. The student is on their own to dig into these libraries and see how the underlying algorithms work.


The exam was poor. Because the first portion of the course covered material which is mostly review for people, the midterm exam was comprised of mostly trick questions and 'gotchas'.


The participation assignments felt largely superficial. They were the sort of thing which could work well on-campus but hadn't been ironed out into a good online format yet.


Lectures


The lectures are professionally done and the professor does a good job ensuring material is engaging and fresh. I definitely skimmed through certain parts, however, as they should be review for most people taking this class in this program. The following are a few examples I feel were unnecessary which were covered at some length:

mean, median, mode
correlation vs. causation
empirical rule



That's not to say all the material was irrelevant. In many cases there was a good balance between current events/real-world examples and concepts from the course. I'd just suggest a bit more technical depth.


Assignments


Case Studies/ Exercises: These are short exercises designed around a controversial topic, current event, or ethical issue. They seem tailored to facilitate an in-person discussion on a topic where students can debate back-and-forth. Online, however, this fell a little flat. The assignments usually mandated that a student "respond to two others" who had answered the question. Unfortunately most students just did this minimum bar and never replied when someone responded to their post. I hope this would be reworked in the future.


Written Critiques: These are more-or-less short essays. The idea is that a student should dive in on a topic or issue and write about it in a bit of length. My biggest issue with these was a lack of clear guidance as to how we'd be graded, but there were some thought-provoking questions


Projects: Several concepts in the course are taught in a more "hands-on" approach, using the projects to showcase concepts. Unfortunately these either are so basic as to be uninteresting to someone with a background in data manipulation in python, or very reliant on specific third-party libraries. This resulted in me not learning too much through the projects, which was a shame. It's cool to see some of the bias mitigation libraries work, but algorithmically I couldn't explain to you how they work in anything more than superficial detail.


The final project is (optionally) a group project. Since grouping was optional I didn't see this as an issue. We were also probably helped out by the fact that most students in the course had been through several OMS courses already and so were not totally incompetent.
Exams
The course is slated to have one midterm exam and one final exam which is not cumulative. This semester, the final exam was dropped and a short mini-project replaced it. The midterm was a bit of a trainwreck; the exam mostly covered some of the basic concepts listed from the lectures above, but attempted to trick students doing silly things like switching units or using subtle language tricks to be misleading. Maybe these concepts are emphasized more heavily on campus, but many students in the online section missed these questions. Thankfully, the teaching team allowed for corrections to be made to recover points.
Grading
The grading for this course was quite lenient. Many of the smaller assignments (case studies etc.) seem to be predominantly graded on completion. My written critiques were also marked with 100%, though I was disappointed I didn't receive any feedback on my responses. Output for the projects is mostly reports with tables of statistics and numeric metrics with some small written portions; these were also graded generously and I never had any of my numbers questioned. Grading for the course was a bit all over the place but the corrections seemed to make up for that. Expect the exam format to evolve.
Last Thoughts
This course has a lot of potential but one could tell it was a first iteration in need of a good polish. The teaching team's willingness to adapt would suggest to me that the course may improve over subsequent semesters. If you're on-the-fence, maybe wait a few semesters and see how things progress, but overall this course is a light-workload introduction to a few technical concepts with a solid grounding in real-world examples.`,rating:3,difficulty:1,workload:5},{user:"Georgia Tech Student",reviewDate:"April 28, 2020",semester:"spring 2020",review:`A new course which was offered in thi semester.

--Overall--
This is a great class. The course content is relevant and curated well. Dr. Howard did a great job giving interesting projects that demonstrated, both in code and in real life, how algorithms can be used to create unfair outcomes and unscientific conclusions.  She was also active on Piazza and in the Slack. TAs were responsive and turned around grades promptly.
--Details--
Class consists of weekly discussions, several written critiques, homework projects, a final project and 2 exams. Weekly discussions are focused on ambiguous real world ethical situations related to AI and students are encouraged to provide their opinions on the topic and respond to one another. There's no grade for being "right" or "wrong" but more around how thoughtful the answer is. Written critiques are just that, you have to write about an ethical dilemma in existing AI technology, but in more depth. Homework projects were probably my favorite. The course starts out much easier and slowly eases you into further analysis. The data analysis can be done any way you like but some of the data sets are so large I'd recommend using Python anyways to make it easier on yourself.
--Areas for Improvement--
If I have any complaints, it's only that this course could be made a bit more challenging. Not in the way of busywork; the pacing was perfect. But some early assignments are a bit too simple, and I'd like to see more coursework developed around building bias mitigation algorithms, automatically evaluating bias in an algorithm's output and writing assignments based on current research in the field (perhaps by replicating an existing paper). This type of material was made available for additional reading but wasn't required in assignments.
--Should you take this as your first class?--
That being said, while the course felt easier than other OMSCS courses, I'd hesitate to recommend it as a first class. The course does assume you know a bit about ML already, and it assumes you are a proficient programmer who can figure out how to write your own analysis code. If you're not from a CS background and are looking for a gentler introduction, take ML4T.
Overall, I think for a first class on this topic, this was excellent. I look forward to how the course will be improved over time.`,rating:5,difficulty:2,workload:8}],reviewSummaries:{"summer 2024":"The course is easy and beneficial for students seeking a lighter workload amidst a busy schedule.
