            review: "\tI took this class in 2024 spring as the first class in OMSCS. As mentioned by some other review, this class was updated dramatically since 2024 spring. It used to be a super easy class, but it's not the case anymore (from some aspect). \n\t\n\tPros:\n\t- The group project is to do a full-stack website for Pokemon battle. This topic is pretty interesting. You have full flexibility to pick your own frameworks, DB. Pretty good chance to practice every aspect of the full-stack dev.\n\t- Grading is not bad. I got an A eventually (I did spend a lot of time on this course though). Especially the final project phase. I really doubt they don’t have enough time to grade everyone and ended up curved the grade.\n\t- Prof seems to really want students to learn something, so I guess that's part of the reason why they are trying to fully revise this class.\n\t\n\tCons:\n\t- You will be really burned out by the messy and disorganized arrangement of this class. The assignment won't clearly tell you how they will test your code, which is really frustrating. TA will tell you something like 'we will test your code with our hidden Pokemon' without either sharing one of their hidden pokemon, or sharing the interface attributes how his hidden pokemon was set up… We will have to guess and wish we guess correctly, which is ridiculous. The released assignment PDF and starter code will be revised many times after publishing, and they will never shout out. You'll have to consistently check back to ensure you are still working on the latest version (I learned this in a hard way to debug for the entire night and eventually figured out that they revised the assignment PDF without publishing an announcement). The exams are super subjective and open ended, so it's really difficult to prepare for it and know exactly what you should write in the answer. \n\t- Many critical info, like changes to assignment, how the exam will be tested and graded, how your code output should look like, will be splattered among tons of Ed post answers and 2-3 hrs office hours/week (and yes, weekly OH is mandatory for this class).\n\t- Ed is really busy for this course as all students are posting actively to clarify what's required for assignment/exam, which made browsing the critical info that TA posted even harder. In our class, there was one student eventually volunteering to summarize all the critical info from Ed and OH for the entire class to track, which is supposed to be done by the TA team (and you can also imagine how messy it was).\n\t- TA will never answer the question straight. He always answers a question with another question, or something like 'I believe/I think'. It turns to be a guess game. Since there are many info that are really not clear for everyone, people tends to ask similar questions from everywhere, and TA will just answer something like 'this was answered in the office hour' without mentioning which date, time frame you should check among 2-3 hrs OH video per week.\n\t- As many other courses, the group project is a big part of this class, and you really want to make sure you have a good team (unfortunately this part is really out of control. My teammates didn't involve that much and I ended up having to do most of the project all by myself). What makes it even worse is, since so many students were disappointed with this course, there ended up have many people drop off the class after midterm, which made the rest of the teammates even more struggling. Prof. and TA did ask the teams to re-hire people as needed, but it's not an easy thing to have a new guy joining your team after midterm and take over the group project code from middle.\n\nAnyways, this class might be getting better after a few semesters assuming they will listen to all the feedback from students and settle down with the assignment/exam/grading and understand what they really want.",

            review: "What could have been, and should have been, one of the best and most important courses in OMSCS ended up being a huge failure.\nThis course has so much potential to teach students the most relevant and industry-related concepts and principles of Software Engineering. However, it feels stuck in the 2000s. There's an excessive focus on UML diagramming, with four weeks of lectures dedicated to it. Additionally, the course feels like a graduate writing course due to the overwhelming number of writing assignments. The course structure is chaotic, with too many components running simultaneously, leading to distractions. Assignment quizzes are based on books and papers outside the course lectures, requiring substantial time to properly learn the material. On top of that, there are project assignments, exams, and lecture quizzes, some of which even test your memory in trivial ways (e.g., how many windows are in a building from a lecture, not an actual question but to emphasize the point). The lectures themselves are outdated, extremely long and difficult to navigate. Furthermore, a portion of the grade depends on viewing all posts on Ed/Canvas and attending/watching mandatory weekly hour-long office hours. I genuinely want one of the course TAs to take this course and see if they can manage everything thrown at them, and have a successful learning outcome. Critical project-related clarifications are buried in minute details sprinkled around Ed comments, which is frustrating.\nThe most disheartening part of this class was never receiving final grades or feedback on the group project that my team and I worked on tirelessly for three weeks, sacrificing our weekends. It feels irresponsible and disrespectful of the students' time. As another review mentioned, it's hard to believe Georgia Tech is allowing such a dysfunctional course to be offered.\nAs someone with 8 years of experience in the software industry, I was particularly disappointed to see how disconnected this course is from the realities of modern software engineering. If the course creators genuinely care about teaching industry-relevant concepts, I would suggest the following improvements:\n\n\nCondense the UML portion of the course to one or two weeks: The industry has largely moved on from the traditional use of UML, and the course is not keeping pace with current practices. Instead, the course should focus on core skills like Architecture and Design Patterns, which are essential for any software developer.\n\n\nFocus on meaningful learning: What does a student gain by answering how many items are in a specific object from a lecture? Please design quiz questions with the student's learning experience in mind. We are here to learn engineering concepts, not to improve our memory.\n\n\nPrioritize quality over quantity: Be realistic about what can be accomplished in 11-15 weeks. Due to the overwhelming number of tasks, my group and I could not focus on the lectures and actual learning. We were constantly distracted by all the additional tasks, which defeats the purpose of the course. Mandatory office hours and Ed discussions are not conducive to learning when we are already swamped with other course requirements.\n\n\nBe timely and respectful with feedback: We spent countless days on the final project, and we deserve to know how we performed. It’s incredibly frustrating that we received our final grades without ever getting any feedback on our group project. Despite all the hard work, we never got to know how we actually did. Additionally, we provided detailed feedback on our teammates for the first half of the project but received nothing in return, which could have helped us improve for the second half. Even more frustratingly, we were asked to provide similarly detailed feedback for the second half, but once again, we got no feedback at all. If feedback isn’t going to be provided, why ask us to invest so much time in it?\n\n\nOverall, as I mentioned at the beginning, I enrolled in this course to learn industry-relevant concepts. When I first saw the course content in week one, I was excited and felt I had made the right choice. However, as the course progressed, I was devastated by how poorly it was executed. It was a complete waste of a course, money, and time. Totally unacceptable.",

            review: "Background: This is my 7th course in the program. I currently work as a developer.\nThis is the worst run course (and least favorite) I've experienced in graduate school (this will be my 3rd graduate degree/program). I'll give an overview and try to be specific to help future students. I have also shared my thoughts directly with the instructors, so hopefully they make some changes.\nFirst of all, I do genuinely think the professor and instructor are interested in students actually learning. I think they mean well, but when it comes time to prepare and do the work, they just don't. The big problems can really be summed up by saying that their ability to communicate expectations just doesn't exist. The assignment documents that are supposed to declare the requirements are unclear and incomplete. They think they can make up for that by making Ed Discussions and office hours required. This means they can throw out random tidbits of information on those platforms and expect those tidbits to become assignment requirements.  In theory, this would be confusing and disorganized, but manageable. I found myself (and my group) reading posts over and over and going back through office hours videos over and over to make sure we didn't miss a change to the assignment requirements. The real problem is that the TA's have different opinions about the requirements. So, you have one TA answer one way on Ed Discussions, then another TA answer another way on office hours, then your grading TA never even read or listened to any of that and have a completely different opinion. For example, our very first group assignment, the first comment (and a few others) for point deductions was a direct contradiction to a written response on Ed Discussions. We pointed this out and were awarded points back - we shouldn't have to do that. Bottom line: ask very detailed questions on Ed Discussions so that it's in writing, and don't let them get away with vague answers. Instructors, if you're reading this, please please please make your assignment requirements crystal clear.\nThey also changed the overall big project assignment from previous semesters, and they were too lazy to fully update the document, so there was a lot of residual, irrelevant, and confusing information.\nThe \"exams\" are quite odd and highly subjective. \"Which of these things is the best and worst and why?\" Your score is very dependent on who grades it and what mood they are in. Some items it seemed like they didn't even read it and just gave a good grade, while other items you'd think \"how on earth is that wrong and why THAT?\"\nThe course lectures are super old and boring. And there are a million of them. And you have to watch them and take regurgitation quizzes. No one involved in the course today had anything to do with those videos at any point in their lifetime.\nFinally, grading. It's slow. And as previously mentioned, it's inconsistent and seemingly random. We never did get a grade or any feedback from the big final project (ya know, the one we spent over 100 man hours on). That's a let down and completely unacceptable in my opinion. It feels like they just never even graded it and gave out final grades. We never got our \"participation\" grades or feedback from our group members. I ended up with an A, but I feel gross about it. Of course I worked hard, but I feel like they just handed out grades randomly.\nI'm glad it's over. I'm upset I wasted my time. As someone who has been an educator my entire adult life (I'm almost 40), I'm disappointed in Georgia Tech for letting this happen.",

            review: "Background: B.S. in CS, 3.5 YOE as an SWE, Java 8 OCA Certified and coding in Java for 12 years.\nI think this course covers really useful material and has a lot of potential. It just needs more focus. It spends too much time on diagrams and on a large group project and not enough time on the course material of software architecture and design. There are massive readings covered by simple quizzes that you have to text search to answer even if you read them. The schedule is flexible and this is a great course to pair with another during a semester. This course will not be very demanding if you have a Java background, however, about 80% of the work for this course takes place in a multi-phase group project so your group will affect your required level of effort significantly. I suggest trying to form a group your self and making sure everyone meets the pre-reqs of the course of having a background in Java - otherwise, you'll end up doing significantly more work and this course can become demanding.\nPre-reqs: Java, some full stack development experience, version control such as Github, knowledge of object-oriented design, knowledge of recursion, and be ready to learn Java Spring Boot in about a week (or better yet learn it ahead of time!).\nTip: Read  / Watch the material on Design Patterns ahead of time (during the first few weeks). That material will be relevant to your exams and projects before it's actually covered.\nExams: Know how to make your class and sequence diagrams. Know some design patterns and software principles you can reference when defending your decisions and you'll do fine.\nProjects: There is safety in the herd. Read Ed Discussions religiously. With hundreds of students, good clarifying questions will be asked there that you'll need for the projects. Also, watch all the office hours. They often contain clarifications or even novel information necessary for the project assignments. Part of the main criticism for the course from students was ambiguity in the project assignments. I think an important point is that what they're trying to assess is not your Java project implementation ability - the projects themselves are not that hard if you knew everything you had to do. What they're assessing is your design ability. The main challenge in some of the phases is reverse-engineering and figuring out how you would design your software to complete the project requirements. That's kind of tricky to find the right balance of how much information to give students because the projects themselves are not difficult. Read the entire assignment description carefully, monitor Ed Discussions, go to office hours, and ask clarifying questions. Think about design principles and try to have your software assume as little as possible, be flexible, and keep in mind you will be modifying the same software over the entire course of the semester.\nFinal Project: You will not have a lot of time and it will be during finals week. Plan out the minimum deliverables you can do that your grader will approve. You are graded on meeting the expectations you propose so set them low and you may always exceed them if you have time. There will be plenty of work to do in those last weeks anyway.\nCourse Staff: Very responsive and transparent about the course. Some mistakes were made during the semester with project grading or project requirements not being stated clearly, but I thought they handled the situations well. It was very clear to me that their priority was our learning in all the decisions made - and that made for a refreshing and pleasant course experience.\nRecommendations for the course: Reduce the material of the course but make it more rigorous and individualized. Have two phases for the major project and reduce diagramming requirements. Get rid of the first minor assignment. Get rid of the reading quizzes - instead do applied learning assignments. Have students produce relevant diagrams, implement different architectures to compare, and do mini assignments around implementing design patterns in Java. Add in individualized mini-assignments having students implementing design patterns from the Gang of Four from the beginning of the course until the end - my biggest regret is not spending more time just implementing design patterns and I feel like the course took time away from me to do that which would have been a more worthwhile use of my time than the group project. Have students do individual Java programming assignments using Github right at the start of the course to enforce course pre-reqs for the benefit of groups later on. It would be good to have some light Spring Boot and full stack mini individual assignments leading up to the final phase to make sure all the group members can contribute to that phase as well.\nOverall: I enjoyed the course. I ended with a high 'A'. I put a lot of effort into this course and think I could have certainly put in less time given a different group composition - so I would expect less time for the course but keep in mind you could be putting in 20 hours / week depending on the group you get. Design Patterns by the Gang of Four is the most useful material in this course and I wish we spent more time on that. I'll probably do my own personal project of going through each of those to learn them.",

Its very important to have at least 3 competent team members else the team projects can get overwhelming and exhaustive. Besides, the course was little less organized and sometimes the responses from from TAs could be vague causing more frustration. We had two Exams for design. Exams were good but as we did not have any practice exam we were not sure what to write. Overall, the course is good and has lots to learn. Having a good team will make it more fun and interesting.',

            review: 'I took this course in spring 2024. The course is based on java and the group assignment requires a good knowledge of the language. Each assignment requires a diagrams like sequence, class, state and deployment. This depends on the assignment requirement.\n\n\nThere were quizzes from course videos and these were considered as practise quizzes, which represents 3% of final score.\n\n\n7 quizzes with 2 attempts. (You wont know which answers were wrong in either of your attempts). The answers would be released after the quiz deadline.\n\n\n1 individual assignment. This is an easy assignment.\n\n\n3 group assignment. You get to pick your team and having a good team is important for this part of assignment. This is a 3 part group assignment where each one is a continuation of the other and in each assignment we have to write code and draw diagrams. For this semester we had pokemon battle and tournament. The first 2 assignments were purely java code.But the final assignment, we will be assigned a mentor who will grade our final assignment. For the  last assignment we were expected to develop a fullstack development.\n\n\nThe lectures were monotonous and the course as a whole, didnt help me much apart from learning some UML concepts and design patterns. But the group assignment were engaging and office hours and Ed discussions(sometimes) really helped as it answered most of the unanswered questions from the assignment.\nEd discussions were chaos as there were multiple threads and keeping track of each one was a hassle. And some of the questions goes unanswered until it was brought up in the office hours.',

Next implementation part, due to the one week delay caused earlier by the TA, we had to complete the project in less than a week. We got a mix of folks with mech background, and others who talk much but dont know any coding. It all ended up with TAs providing a low score even though we have a total working solution that met all the requirements. I am totally disappointed with this.',

Some of the concepts are a bit outdated but the overall lessons are still important. Out of everything I learned, I think understanding the different diagrams (class model diagrams, sequence diagrams, etc) are the most useful thing to learn and understand. As for projects, I took this class in Summer 2023 and timing is a big issue. The first 2 projects are fairly easy and they give you 3 weeks (2 for the 1st and 1 for the second) to finish them. This honestly is too much time, in reality, they should make the 1st project only 1 week and add the extra week to project 5. Taking this class in the summer does put an extra time constraint as well. All the projects in this class build on each other for the final group project and you should definitely try to find a good team. The last 2 weeks are definitely the most amount of work since that is when the group project opens and you don't have a lot of time to finish it. I personally spent 5 hours a week doing the projects, and quizzes, and watching the lectures for the majority of the time. The last 2 weeks are when I spent about 30 hours/week working on the group project.",

The projects are made unnecessarily complex by giving vague data. The projects wont open early. The TAs will take days to respond, finally you will be left with just one weekend to do all the project coding. Many of the TAs work remotely and I had a TA who had completely opposite timezone as mine. You need to stay awake late nights to communicate via teams and their responses take hours. Since I took this for summer, some of the lectures were mentioned optional. But they would expect to attend the practice quizzes for the optional lectures too!! The group project is a total disaster. You will be given just one week to complete it along with colleagues who don't know anything about coding.",

            semester: 'fall 2022',
            review: 'This was my last course in the OMSCS program.  I took it during the Fall 2022 term.  Analyzing and testing software has always been a black box for me.  I knew I tested stuff as I code, but I knew I was lacking an understanding of more than just that.\nCoursework\n\nSyllabus Quiz (2%): This is a Canvas quiz to test your knowledge of the syllabus.  It is proctored through Honorlock, just to get everyone familiar with using Honorlock.  You must get a 100 on this quiz in order for other material in Canvas to unlock.  You can take this as many times as necessary.\nLecture Quizzes (1.5% each): These consist of Canvas quizzes covering the material for each Ed module.  The first quiz allows 2 attempts, but every other quiz only allows one attempt.  These are open everything.  There are 11 of these corresponding to the 11 lecture modules in Ed.\nExam (20%): There is only one exam in this course, and it is treated as a midterm.  It is proctored through Honorlock.  You have a limited amount of time to take the exam.  You are allowed one page of notes in PDF format that must follow a pre-determined format.\nLabs (60%): Several of these consisted of application of lecture/lesson topics.  Lab 0 was an introduction to LLVM, although there was no true corresponding lecture for LLVM.  Lab 1 was a pain in the rear and probably the hardest of all the labs.  It consisted of 3 parts: "simple" dynamic analysis, mutational fuzzing, and feedback-directed fuzzing.  The first part was a true challenge.  Most of my time was spent trying to figure out what the lab assignment wanted as well as a lot of time looking through LLVM documentation, which, as one instructor put it, "documentation that leaves a lot to be desired."  I appreciate the lab videos to try and explain the lab, but after watching hours of lectures, watching a 45-90 minute video just to get an introduction to the lab seems a little excessive... we are going to spend this time telling you are going to have to learn everything on your own, and like every other lab assignment, if you don\'t know LLVM, be prepared to spend over 75% of your time looking through documentation and trying to piece together what they are wanting you to turn in.\nParticipation (125 points): This consisted of 3 parts: Ed participation, group project feedback, and lecture/module quizzes.  For the participation points, you had to submit meaningful posts and replies on Ed.  This had to be more than an "I agree", or "good point."  Many people used it to ask lost of questions about UML diagramming and questions about the assignments.  The practice quizzes mentioned above are also a part of this grade.  While the grades on those quizzes do not count directly to these points, completing all the practice quizzes with a perfect score was all but required.  Lastly, your team\'s feedback on your group project played a huge role in these points.  Make sure you are on a good team, be a good team player, and be sure your team knows your contributions to the success of the project.\n\nTake-Aways\n\n\nMiscellaneous Stuff: I prefer a project heavy course instead of exams; however, I read and agree with other reviews in the sense the mid-term exam is fair, especially with being able to take a sheet of notes into the exam.  I despise exams in general.  LLVM was a true PITA as a lot of students expressed this same sentiment.  Even a lecture on what LLVM actually is and how to use it would be better than what they gave us.  In Graduate Algorithms, the lectures would cover what divide-and-conquer is, and when it came time for the homework, you had to answer questions with a D&C algorithm explained.  In this course, it was more along the lines of, this is sort of what fuzzing is, now go do Lab 1, read through the LLVM documentation to figure out how to do something, and then do it.\nThe "office hour" is held in Slack, which seems strange to me.  No recordings, you can only make a general post, you cannot DM a TA unless they DM you first.  Just all around.... odd in comparison to other classes I have taken which used multiple platforms.\nBe prepared to spend a lot of time on LLVM.  Labs 1 and 2, I didn\'t submit until like 3 hours before they were due, only because of trying to understand LLVM took that long.\n\n\nQuizzes:\n\nThe graded quizzes cover specific material from a given week(s) lecture and reading material.  The assignment quiz guide they provide at the beginning of the course outlines what material will be on what quiz.  They are open material quizzes covering the lecture in question.  Only the first quiz allows multiple attempts.\n\n\n\nLectures: The lectures were pretty decent and able to keep my attention.  I feel they could use a little work and updating.\n\n\nTextbook: There is no textbook required.\n\n\nLabs: The labs were acceptable and manageable; however, more introduction to LLVM would be appreciated by all.  If you don\'t research LLVM before the class starts, prepare to sink or swim.  Become familiar with LLVM!!!  You are basically given the lab spec, a VM, and a link to all the LLVM documentation for you to figure out the lab.  There is some correlation between some labs and lessons, but not as much as I have seen in other classes.  Some of the labs build on the previous lab, but they do not give you any working starting point.  "You will design a reaching definition analysis, then a live variables analysis, using Z3."  Lab 2 required implementing a Reach Definition Analysis algorithm, so if you didn\'t get a working solution in that lab, you are out of luck as you are not given any working starting point, so essentially you have to go back and redo Lab 2 to get a working solution before you can even begin Lab 3.\n\n\nExams:  The exam seemed fair, especially getting to have a page of notes handy.  Also, knowing what topics would be covered in the exam helped the studying process.  Go through and understand the sample questions and understand them as the exam is very similar in nature to the sample questions.\n\n\nProfessor and TAs: The entire teaching staff was great.  The TAs have a very obvious present in Ed.\n\n\nExtra Credit: There was an opportunity for some extra credit.  This was based on your participation in Ed as well as the number of useful posts or replies you made.\n\n\nGrading: One thing to note is they do not release any statistics in Canvas.  So, unlike other classes, you cannot really gauge where you lie in terms of the rest of the class.  They do release this for the Exam in Ed, but not for the individual labs in Canvas.  Would have been nice to see if my Lab X grade was similar to others in the course, or did I just really do that bad.\n\n\nOverall Grade: Because of the LLVM stuff, I almost failed the course.  When my average was around 35-40, I determined it was mathematically impossible to bring my grade up to a C in order to pass.  I opted to withdraw from the course.\n\n\nTLDR\nI fully regret starting this course, but was relieved to withdraw from it.  Some people complain about Grad Algorithms being rough.  While I did leave a true, complaining review for GA when I took it, I feel this course is far worse than that class.  It is no where near an analysis or testing course.  Honestly, it is more of a compiler course.  A course title like Formal Analysis and Correctness Proofs would be more appropriate.  It has a lot of potential... it really does.  But the sink or swim mentality with LLVM is not very conducive to learning.  This class is somewhat straightforward but definitely not easy.  There is a lot of emphasis on LLVM... to the extent of it being used on every Lab assignment.  If you are unfamiliar with LLVM or don\'t research it before the class, you may struggle the whole way through the class, because honestly, learning the LLVM stuff is truly sink or swim.  I know I did, but at the same time, I had no idea the extent of LLVM we needed to know.  When they say to not chat with anyone about a lab, take that seriously.  Ask questions on Ed.  I am not sure if they monitor or scan Teams messages of students, but if you do talk with someone about a lab, be prepared to be contacted by an instructor.  Start looking at C++, pointer references, and LLVM and become a little familiar with them before taking this class; otherwise, you will be spending a lot of your time trudging through documentation.  Because of this LLVM stuff, I would highly recommend taking a different course.  Even an instructor/TA mentioned during the initial lesson 0 video that this class will not teach you to code better.  Instead, they want you to figure out how to inject code to handle a divide-by-zero error in Lab 1 instead of just addressing it in the calling code.  On the plus side, the instructional staff tries to hold to the commitment of the student getting their grade within 2 weeks of the assignment being due.\nThis class has a lot of potential, but the course description couldn\'t be any more misleading.  Just keep your head down, don\'t talk to anyone in the course outside of Ed, learn, memorize, and bury your life in nothing but LLVM for the entirety of this course.  Otherwise, you will be doomed to fail as I did.  My only saving grace was being able to withdraw before the deadline.',

            review: "For background, this was my 9th course in OMSCS. I come from a STEM background (EE) and I have a STEM job (CS/IT).\nWell, I don't know how much I can add beyond what's already being said by other students. This was by far the worst course I have taken so far. The course falls short in several aspects.\nThe lectures are extremely boring and have a clear disconnect from everything else in the class. I do not blame the instructor team for this since software engineering can be a boring subject in general outside of the development projects. I do however recommend bridging the gap between lectures and projects. So things like, we studied XYZ this past two weeks and now the next assignment is going to exercise that.\nThere are quizzes associated with lectures that don't count towards your grade directly but towards class participation. There are six graded quizzes that count directly towards your grade. Lowest score from the six is dropped. Quizzes are open everything.\nProjects gradually get worse as you go on in the class, with the last one being extremely open ended. A TA is assigned to you as a \"client\" and you are at the mercy of the TA. We probably got the worst one who kept giving conflicting and vague statements. It was a very frustrating process. I don't buy into the argument of \"well that's what real world clients are like\". They don't try to withhold information for the purposes of grading and at least tell you what they want implemented. My group was good! I did not know anyone personally, just connected through EdStem posts when TAs allowed team forming.\nThe professor attended office hours and responded to a few posts on EdStem. The TA team was not always helpful, sometimes even answering a question with a question or just giving vague answers. Grade turn around was extremely slow. In some cases we started the next phase of the project without having any feedback on the previous one.\nOverall, I would not recommend this course even if you are looking for buffer class between hard ones. It can grow frustrating really quickly.",

            review: 'Poorly designed class. TAs and Professor are there for most of it but one major flaw with the class is that the lectures do NOT line up with the assignments.\nThe general ideas of the lectures are apparent in the assignments but the detailed minutiae that the assignments expect is not covered. There is a course textbook but even in there, some of the material is not readily available and you are at the mercy of TA’s releasing information on Ed Discussions.\nThe lectures are connected to the quizzes and cover so much unnecessary information. Quizzes are primarily T/F and have two tries which, if left this way, quizzes will be an easy grade.\nThe last two projects are team based. The requirements are vague and in our case, the assigned TA to help us define our group specific requirements was often not there.\nThe final group project is coding based on a previous solo assignment in Java. It is reasonable but tedious.\nOverall, I did not enjoy this course very much. The lectures are irrelevant and the projects are tedious. As for content that is actually learned, UML diagramming is really the only concept that is pushed. Other than that, if you have not used Java before, this course may be helpful if you wanted to learn.',

I still use my UML learnings now and then to get a point across whenever I need to discuss with my team about code fixes (as opposed to showing code on screen which can be tedious). They are strict when grading UML diagrams though. Assignments are good but very slow turn around for grading. I enjoyed anything after the UML diagram assignments. I am in Hardware. I never had formal CS background so yeah, I still found this class useful!\nLectures:\nVery boring\nStaff:\nDr. Moss and staff are very helpful, in terms of setting expectations for assignments during office hour calls. Attend them or listen to recordings later.\nGroup project:\nBe proactive though for the group project when finding teammates. As soon as the Ed Post is released for group formations, post info immediately. Chances are the early posters are also going to be good teammates as well. I found myself a fine group and learned a lot from them.",

If we have the ability to review others\' designs, why do we need to take this course?\nThe videos are clipped to tens of dozens of 1-minute short videos, which are very very distracting and pathetic. It feels like the course team was preparing the course without brains.\nI hereby warn anyone who would like to take this course, which would put your time and efforts in vain.',

            review: "This was my ninth course in the OMSCS program.  I took it during the Summer 2022 term.  Having got past the hurdle of Graduate Algorithms, my sanity needed a breather.  I chose this class for that reason... that, and I am a software developer by profession.  Therefore, I feel any software class where I at least learn something is a win for my career.  This class consists of some quizzes, an individual project, a team project, discussion forum participation, and completion of Canvas module quizzes.  There is a lot of focus on diagrams and the software process in general.  Instead of percentages, a total points scale (1000) is used.\nCoursework\n\nPractice Quizzes: These consist of the Canvas quizzes covering the material in each module.  You can take them over and over until you receive full points.  While they do not directly count towards your grade, they are a part of the participation grade.  It is very tedious, time-consuming, and frustrating having to take some quizzes 5+ times until you get all available points.  You must continue taking these until you get a perfect score as thy do play a part in your participation score\nQuizzes (150 points): There are 6 quizzes in the class.  The lowest grade of the quizzes is dropped.  They are open everything (except fellow students and googling the answer).  You have 1 hour to take them in Canvas, and they are not proctored.  You are given a guide early in the class as to what material will be covered in the quiz.  You are allowed 2 attempts, with the highest score counting.  It is easy to review the quiz and better prepare yourself for the second attempt if you have to retake it.\nAssignments (725 points): These consist of various processes throughout the software design process.  Assignment 1 was to create a UML diagram based on a spec which was provided.  Assignment 2 was to review 3 diagrams provided to you and provide feedback.  Assignment 3 was to implement the program identified as part of A1 and A2.  The spec for this was very vague, and a lot of inferences and Ed posts are necessary to understand what is really being asked.  Assignment 4 is the start of the team project.  It requires taking the program discussed in A1-A3, adding some functional and non-functional requirements, create some new documentation, and update existing ones.  Assignment 5 is for the team to take the program from A3 and implement these functional and non-functional requirements, generate more new documents, update the documents from A4 as the code evolves, and record videos to submit.  Assignment 6 is purely a placeholder for the CATME survey/evaluation of yourself and your teammembers.\nParticipation (125 points): This consisted of 3 parts: Ed participation, group project feedback, and lecture/module quizzes.  For the participation points, you had to submit meaningful posts and replies on Ed.  This had to be more than an \"I agree\", or \"good point.\"  Many people used it to ask lost of questions about UML diagramming and questions about the assignments.  The practice quizzes mentioned above are also a part of this grade.  While the grades on those quizzes do not count directly to these points, completing all the practice quizzes with a perfect score was all but required.  Lastly, your team's feedback on your group project played a huge role in these points.  Make sure you are on a good team, be a good team player, and be sure your team knows your contributions to the success of the project.\n\nTake-Aways\n\n\nMiscellaneous Stuff: Not having to worry about exams is a plus.  I despise them.  I am not the biggest fan of a points system, but in the end, it is a wash with a percentage system.  For the points system, A: 900-1000, B:800-899, C:700-199, D: 600-699, F: 0-599.  The turnaround time on assignments is horrendous.  A3 was due on 27 June 2022, but grades for it were released on 22 July 2022... almost a month later.  Part of the A3 assignment was code they ran through an autograder, so not really sure whey they couldn't have done that and got those grades to us while they worked on grading the documentation.  When I got my A3 grades, I had to constantly send an Ed message to the TA team to get feedback as they failed to upload comments on my submissions, which reduced the amount of time I had to determine if I wanted to make a regrade request or not.\n\n\nQuizzes:\n\nThe practice quizzes are mind-numbing.  Some of them you have to take over and over and over until you get a perfect score.  While they don't count towards your grade, they are an essential part of the participation grade.\nThe graded quizzes cover specific material from a given week(s) lecture and reading material.  The assignment quiz guide they provide at the beginning of the course outlines what material will be on what quiz.\n\n\n\nLectures: The lectures are from when the class was created in the past.  The instructor is pretty much reading off the slides.  It is like being in a classroom where the professor purely reads off the slides and isn't free-thinking.  It all feels too scripted.  The lectures where the professor is trying to have a conversation with someone about a task is enough to put you to sleep as it definitely feels scripted.  The content could be really good if it was updated; however, it is mediocre, dry, and boring, which is a perfect combination to lose interest.\n\n\nTextbook: There is no textbook required.\n\n\nProjects: The individual project was broken into 3 Assignments (take a spec and create the UML class diagram, evaluate 3 other student's diagrams with the spec and give meaningful feedback, and implementing the program based on the spec).  The team project built on top of the individual project by introducing functional and non-functional requirements, required creating new and updating existing documentation, implementing the program based on the spec and changes to the spec, and evaluating the contributions of your team members.\n\n\nExams:  There are no exams.\n\n\nProfessor and TAs: The entire teaching staff was great.  Matt and Pablo do a great job with feedback in Ed.  They step in only to re-align incorrect statements, answer when no one else has answered, or confirm a student's reply.  They really try to let the students help each other instead of just coming in and answering all the questions.  This gives students ample time to work on those participation points.\n\n\nExtra Credit: There was an opportunity for some extra credit.  The professors started everyone off with 10 points of extra credit, which evaluates to 1% being added to your final grade.  There were stipulations, though.  Anytime someone requested to have their CATME team member evaluation reopened because they didn't follow instructions, everyone lost 0.4 points of the 10 available points until the value reached 0.  So, anytime anyone made a post on the thread, everyone lost points from the extra credit points, regardless if you followed instructions or not.  This allows for 25 re-open requests, and they get used up quickly, even with people asking when their survey would be reopened.\n\n\nOverall Grade: I put an acceptable amount of time in this course (over 146 hours to be exact).  In the end, my grade was 96.4, which got me an A.  At the end of the course, I saw an A was posted to my transcript, but it wasn't until 7 days after grades are due to the registrar that I saw my grades for Assignment 5, Assignment 6, and Participation.\n\n\nTLDR\nThis class is pretty much straightforward and somewhat easy.  The course is designed to focus on the diagramming and designing of software.  As such, don't expect a lot of programming.  Be sure to get all those participation points.  Find a good team.  Look past the painful monotony of the lectures and practice quizzes.  Prepare to wait and wait and wait for grades and feedback... like, expect some grades to appear in Canvas after the course ends and grades are required to be submitted to the registrar for your transcript.",

            review: 'This course was terrible, and horrible waste of time.\nI rated the difficulty a 3/5. The course content itself is not hard at all, 1/5. The difficulty comes into play with the extremely short deadlines given for assignments, coupled with the fact that assignments build off each other, and assignment grades are ALWAYS late, so you go blindly into it. When the TAs are asked when grades will be complete, the answer was typically "when they are done" or "you don\'t need them". Super disrespectful lot of TAs.\nYou are forced into a group project, of at least 3 people, for work that could have been 1 person driven and handled. There was no aspect of the project that demanded more than 1 person, if that 1 person was willing to do it all themselves.\nThe course content and work ended 2 weeks earlier than the semester, and the grades were still late.',

            review: "This class was weird. The first 70-80% was very easy. The final group project though, worth a lot of points, was incredibly hard. They gave little information on it, but all previous assignments we were told were building up to it. They had us plan out in Assignment 4 what to do for Assignment 5 (the final project), but we didn't know what Assignment 5 would be.\nThe problem is that the hardest parts of the course are the actual developing and coding, and the architecture stuff is easy. Thankfully, at least the architecture stuff is worth a lot of points. In order to achieve our dream architecture, my team had to learn a lot of external, 3rd party pieces of software from the ground up in less than 3 weeks, which was unnecessarily hard for an architecture class. I crammed basically a whole semesters worth of learning in 3 weeks, and the other weeks of the semester I hardly learned anything.",

            review: "If not for the sake of 500$ that I spend on this course, already wasted effort and the eagerness to finish the degree a bit early, I would have dropped it just before the deadline.\nSuch is the quality of any aspect of it:\n\nLectures: The professor just reads the text and the content is completely useless. Pretended conversation with a student was so pathetic.\nQuizzes: Ideally, lectures should explain concepts and quizzes would test student's understanding of it. Having the questions to be highly subjective and exactly the same as that present in the lectures will only make the students copy the answers. I did the same and the experience was awful (Hint: it contributes to only 1.5% of overall grading. OMG, I should have skipped!)\nAssignments: In my experience of more than a decade in a variety of software engineering projects, I would have used UML utmost a couple of times. And having about 50% of overall assignment grading on these useless diagrams is simply awful. In every other course I have taken so far, I have learned something mostly via assignments, but it is ridiculously useless and annoying in this course. Only thing I learnt was the existence of PlantUML which also turned out to be a mistake because the TA cares more about color, layout, symbols than the content (Hint: Don't use OCL in these diagrams). Not all test cases are provided before the grading results are available for coding projects. Who writes Architectural Decision Records? WTF?\nGroup project: Given that most students target this course for its easiness, it may fall on you to do the heavy lifting if you don't act appropriately. Though the end result was fruitful, it ended up this way for me.\n\nThe only reason I took up the course is to pair it with another and the comments on several reviews and conversations with former students that the grading is lenient. But as some reviews suggest, be aware that it depends on individual TA. I ended up with a horrible one and if not for the grades given by them, you may end up frustrated by their early comments and responses in regrade requests. Luckily, TAs change for individual and group project and that pretty much saved me to get an A.\nThe biggest lesson I learnt by taking this course is that it is better to take relatively harder but highly rated courses at a slower pace.",

The group project is entirely dependent on your teammates and I lucked out so that was actually the highlight of the course for me. Heads up, you don't have to use a database, can just write data to JSON files if you think that's easier (we did). The Java part of the course was fairly easy given I use it daily. If you're thinking about taking this class as an easy A, just remember that you have to do 30 lecture quizzes repeatedly until you get 100%. Making the UML diagrams for the assignments can also be annoying. The lecture videos are not good at all, though Instructor Moss > Professor Rugaber (lecturer) so definitely reach out to Moss in office hours whenever you need anything, he's really helpful.",

Ask them this before you let them join your group!\nIt's not worth the risk taking a non-cs! It will determine your grade (group project is like 40%) !",

            review: 'Extremely boring and tedious class. Its like the creators deviced the perfect way to make a class thats both easy and annoying at the same time.\nThe lectures are as boring as they get, and they go over so much unecessary detail that is completely outdated. I have worked in top-tier tech companies and people there use maybe 5% of the things explained in this class. Then there are lecture quizes which you will most likely brute-force because you have unlimited retries and its impossible to get perfect scores the first time, because they ask things like: "select all answers that apply", and then there are like 20 different checkboxes which you can select.\nThe assignments are tedious as well. Make uml diagrams, make sequence diagrams, go back and fix other people uml diagrams. Then there is the individual and group project. The individual project wasnt bad, but the TAs graded them so poorly. The TAs, just like you, didnt care at all about this class, so they never answered any emails, took ages to answer anything in Ed discussion, and graded assignments by glancing at them and then giving it a score without paying any attention, so many students had to ask for regrades. Then the group project, where you are matched with 4 other students, who took this class just to get an easy A but who have horrible coding skills. Have fun fixing your teammates horrible code while dealing with unresponsive TAs.\nThis class is pretty bad and its in grave need of a rework, but if you are looking for an A, then this may be one of your few options to take. But if you are willing to put some more effort and actually learn something, I\'d recommend taking anything else.  I was not, so I do not regret taking it, but i wish it wasnt as painful as it was.',

I would recommend using Codecademy.\nOur final project builts on Java spring boot and mongo db, and demo using the Swagger UI . MVC and DAO pattern are used in our project as well. When working on unfamiliar technologies on the fly with others, I found UML diagrams are helpful for me to understand what attributes, operations and connections to take care of. It is almost impossible to remember the whole architecture in mind.\nOn the downside, the TAs and instructors are not as responsive as other courses in the forum. The final project took us 21 days.

            review: "I have mixed feelings about this course.  I was excited to take it because I thought I would get a chance to learn in depth about different design patterns, something that seems important but also an area where I don't have a lot of experience.  Actually very little of this course was about patterns -- which in itself is more a demonstration of my own ignorance than a fault with the course.  The subject of this course, overall, is the considerations that go into designing software systems from the initial requirements phase, to the analysis of those requirements and the production of models, to the implementation, and then to the incorporation of \"non-functional\" concerns like reliability, scalability, etc.  The assignments mirror this structure: you'll start with a description of a system and be asked to produce a diagram of the system using UML, then you'll implement the system, finally you'll work with a team to extend the system to address additional concerns both pre-assigned and of your own choosing.  Alongside the assignments are lectures that discuss different design considerations, different kinds of diagrams used for modeling software structure and behavior, and different ways of assessing design.\nFirst, on the difficulty: as others have said, I don't think it's fair to call this an \"easy\" course.  There are no major challenges in terms of algorithms, it's true -- and you won't be cursing under your breath trying to synchronize threads or deal with double-pointers as in GIOS.  But there is a good deal of work involved in doing things right, the assignments are, as is typical of this program, vague, and the group project introduces its own synchronization challenges which, if anything, can be more frustrating than synchronizing threads.  I guess it's possible to half-ass the assignments and get by if you have a good familiarity with Java and a smattering of UML (or just common sense about drawing diagrams) -- but you can find yourself quite as stressed, if you are trying to do a good job on the assignments, as you would in any course.  And the Summer schedule is compressed, so that adds to the overall load.\nI think the idea for this course is good, and the projects fit nicely into that idea.  I guess the major issue is the execution.  There are weekly office hours, but they become pile-ons for logistics and \"what do I have to do to get a good grade on this assignment\" (not to say that isn't a fair concern), so they don't do much to make the content engaging.  Some TA's (this semester the heroic Pablo Gallastegui and also Eric Weinberg, along with some others) are present in Slack and will answer questions.  But ... for a subject matter that could be very interesting -- how do you design good software systems, and how do you KNOW what makes a software system well designed -- I just feel like the intellectual engagement isn't there.\nPart of the problem here is in the supporting structure, as usual: the professor who created the original lectures is gone; those lectures are ... OK, if at times a bit hokey, but I don't feel like the professor is super enthusiastic in his delivery of the material -- often it seems like he's reading notes that are well organized but ultimately formulaic.  There are sort of \"theatrical\" bits that come off like attempts to bring interest into material that should be interesting in itself.  There are a lot of readings around the lectures, but I got lazy and skipped some of them -- even though the ones I skipped were not bad, one of them even seems quite good.  That is because around this shell structure the new instructors and TA's have erected a series of reading quizzes.  The readings for those quizzes are OK, and the quizzes themselves aren't hard, but it feels like they pull in a slightly different direction than the original lectures, and they are what is assessed.  Yes, there are some \"practice quizzes\" tied to the original lectures and those are just...awful.  You have to do them again and again to get 10/10 (well you really don't, but the syllabus at least says you're supposed to do that) -- and in the end you might have 10 attempts and just be praying not to have a single-word answer quiz come up that you can't divine what it wants.  One of those quizzes I failed again and again until I realized I wasn't capitalizing the single-word answer.  Not conducive to learning!\nSo I think this course has some good ideas, some good projects, and a potentially interesting subject area.  The problem is it really just is trying to do too much and is hanging on to an original structure it has outgrown.  I would like -- in this course and in other OMSCS courses I've taken -- to go deeper into one area of the subject matter, to have some assignments that experiment with deeper student engagement, and to have less of a feeling in myself and other students as we go through the course, \"What do I have to do to get full marks here?\"  There's potential in this course, but there are also a lot of frustrating aspects, and in the compressed Summer schedule, it will make you wonder a little bit why you're going back to the basement of your apartment to work through another reading quiz rather than sitting out with everyone else at the restaurants and bars and enjoying the summer evenings.",

            review: "I know some out there are reading this thinking that it's an easy A course, how bad could it be. I went in with that mentality at least and ended up dropping because the material is more bland than reading an encyclopedia. I'm not sure how other companies handle software architecture but I find it hard to believe UML has widespread acceptance considering how many details are embedded into it just to understand the symbology of it all, or the monotony of creating diagrams. I had taken a similar course before that focused on creating a whole model package more than just focusing on certain kinds of diagrams.\nThe participatory quizzes are tough to get through to get 100% your first time around so you just end up guessing after enough tries until you've wasted more time than they're worth.\nThe overarching project concept shows potential to be interesting as it's gathering how you break down a multi-faceted real life problem but unfortunately the homework does not accurately reflect your ability to process this information and is caught up in UML symbology too much. I didn't think the grading makes any sense either. I received a mediocre grade on my first assignment because my diagrams were overly-complicated and yet I'm positive I reviewed others' work that looked like it could have been pencil-whipped in an hour who most likely received a better grade.\nBy the 3rd assignment (the second is peer reviews) I just had no motivation to continue watching boring lectures, reading about material I apparently was not interested in, or continuing for what I think is little practical knowledge gain. I'm usually happy to take drier courses if I learn a little bit and they're not too intense, I should have taken the previous reviews on here more seriously.",

You won't learn anything useful.\nSuper unorganized course, they decided to not use piazza and instead use Canvas Discussion which was a disaster. TAs not respond to questions just made it even worse.\nVery slow on grading assignments, the group assignment grade was released on the last day before grade was due, and don't expect to get any useful feedback from TA.\nInefficient office hour, lots of useless information to listen through.",

            review: 'I see lot of "very easy", "boring" etc reviews about this course. However, I would like to emphasize that this course is not about your programming/coding skills or about the effort required to complete your assignment, but it is about making architectural decisions.\nWith my almost 21 years of commercial experience of building software, I have to say that this course is a "summary of my personal style for the building software solutions from the scratch" based on my personal mistakes and challenges I have experienced in the past.\nSo, if you are at the very beginning of your career, this course might set a vector/direction on your vision for how to architect software solution, and avoid very rough issues around that. If you a already have years of experience, it just will just help you to "polish/brush" your already existing knowledge.\nAgain, the course is based on the material from the early 2000 and eralier time, when it just started to get a primary focus/shape of all "already known these days" methodologies and approaches on how to architect a software solution, so you will have an idea about the reasons why it is important to define, build and follow the process.\nThis course definitely will not add any points to your "coding" skills, but it is very useful about the decisions you make when architect your software solutions.',

All the assignments, minus the group project if you have group members that are dead, useless weight and wonder how they even got into this program in the first place, should take you no more than a day or two to complete. Lectures are the absolutely useless so dont waste time on them. You can take quizzes twice with the same questions, so it basically guarantees you get a 100 on all of them. Overall, find a good group in the beginning and plan to do a whopping total of 20 hours of work from the projects if you have previous Java and software engineering experience.',

If you want to actually learn something, pick another class.\nit's literally ALL UML, no useful information to be found here.\nThe 95% of the class is graded off of 6 quizzes and 7 assignments.\nQuizzes:\nThe quizzes are stupid easy and you can do them twice, with the same questions. Do the math.\nAssignments:\nOf the 7 Assignments: 3 are done individually, 2 are as a group, and the other two are CATME surveys. They all tie into each other in making something, this semester was a streaming software business simulator.\n\n\nThe first assignment is making a class diagram of the service. Doesn't need to be right, or even good.\n\n\nThe second is peer reviewing other peoples. Again just need to add comments.\n\n\nThis is probably the assignment that took the longest. You do an individual implementation. Assuming you know Java and OOP (this is a masters program) you can throw something together in one sitting.\n\n\nCATME Survey for forming your group\n\n\nA team diagram. Basically you'll take whoevers Assignment 1 you like the most, throw a few extra things on it and turn it back in\n\n\nA group implementation. All the group implementation is over the individual one is a few additions. The work is easily spread among your group and assuming you have a decent group ( I did ) it will be very easy\n\n\nAnother CATME survey\n\n\nThe Lectures\nThe lecture in this class are just straight garbage. I don't like how the lecturer talks, and whenever he brings in his guests he acts like they're the dumbest people to have ever walked the earth. The content is disorganized and repetitive, at least the lectures have some decent production value. Each lecture has a quiz at the end which may or may not count for a lot of points. I generally let the lectures run in the background while doing something important.\nThe lectures are 95% UML, despite expecting you to work in a group project, collaboration tools, and other development processes are barely mentioned.\nAlso this is the first semester they decided to use the discussions tab inside of canvas instead of Piazza, and I never thought id say this, but Piazza is so much better and I wish more than anything that this class used Piazza. The Canvas discussions page has no organization and it was impossible to find any information about the class issued by the Gas\nOverall I say 1 hour a week because there were many weeks where I did nothing but let the lecture run in the background, its an extremely easy class to pair with something else, and if you're looking to grab an easy A, its the low hanging fruit.",

The quizzes and participation points were easy freebies.\nAlthough some weeks required more dedication due to granular things that you may want to improve when working on any assignment, it is a good class that teaches you to design code before implementing it, which can be somewhat helpful in the real world. It is a good starter course for those with little to no prior Java experience as well.',

            review: "This was the first course I took in the OMSCS program and I chose it because at this point I had 2 years of professional experience as an iOS developer, and figured it could be a nice introduction into the program.\nCourse Content:\nThe course went through many topics like UML, OCL, state transition tables, design patterns, etc. I think it was a relatively good overview to give you some familiarity with the kinds of things that are out there. The projects focused heavily on UML and Object-Oriented programming in Java.\nCourse Content Delivery:\nThe content was delivered in the form of 1 to 2 minute videos by the lecturer. They were a bit of a slog to get through, and I felt that creating a transcript would have been a more efficient method of getting information across.\nOverall Thoughts:\nThis was definitely an easy class that did not take much time commitment. If you have a reasonable amount of experience in the software development field, I believe you will have an easy time of it. At the end of the day, what you get out of a course is what you put into it, and unfortunately I did not put as much into it as I would have liked. Perhaps this was exacerbated by the fact that the quizzes following each set of lecture videos could be taken multiple times, and that there were no exams. So the projects really only tested a subset of the course content.\nI also felt that it was too heavily focused on UML and Object-Oriented code. Firstly, I don't know anywhere that still uses UML - and the way we were expected to use UML in some of the projects (updating the UML as we went) showed me why. I understand using UML for up-front design and thinking through the architecture, but I can't imagine anyone still would want to update as they went - it gets out of date fast and very easily. As far as object-orientation, I use a functional approach at work and so wasn't very interested in learning OOP patterns, but maybe that's just me (and maybe I'm wrong in doing this).\nMy dislike rating is more about not being as excited about the course content as I thought I would be. If you're interested in modern software architecture principles, I think you could do better than OOP / \"Clean Code\" / SOLID, etc.",

There are no exams, only quizzes, which are very easy given the reading material.\nDr Moss is nice and fairly helpful in the office hours. He also cleared up some of the ambiguity in the project requirements between office hours and piazza, so make sure you are trawling those as needed. One TA was fairly rude across all communication channels, but the rest were fine.\nAs a Hardware Engineer by trade, with an intermediate programming background, even I didn't learn much from this class. Definitely an easy A if you just put in the work (5 hours a week averaged over the semester), though be prepared to just \"do your best\" with the UML. Additionally, the lectures are the worst I've seen so far, though this is my third class and apparently the other two I've taken set the bar fairly high.\nOverall I'd recommend it as an easy A but slightly frustrating. Also you MIGHT learn some better design/architecture practices if you force yourself to use them, though you likely already employ this if you are a software engineer.",

            review: "This course was easy. As already mentioned in previous reviews, it relies heavily in UML, but I don't agree with that being wrong. UML gives a good framework and best practices to build upon.\nMy biggest gripe with the course was really with the video lectures. They are not as well produced as others like HCI or SDP, in the sense that they are very short, they don't have include a hand or a pointer to what is being presented in the video to better reference what is being talked about, content disappears while you want to still look at it, and the inclusion of a \"student\" to make the videos more dynamic just turns into a waste of time. But more than that, the lectures are not very much related to the assignments and projects of the class, and it's like the lectures are going one way but Prof. Moss and the TAs are going another way. Most of the content of the lectures isn't even addressed or useful for the assignments, just the first two or three sections were relevant. I stopped watching after that because I didn't even feel like the content was going to be useful to me.\nThe projects were the right amount of challenging and as long as you can do Java programming you'll be good. For the group project, I was glad that they were more flexible, and we could even choose another language or stack to work with (we did a Springboot backend in AWS along with an iOS app as frontend).\nAs a whole, it was a good introduction/deep dive on UML, and good practice for creating software projects from scratch, but I didn't learn much more than what I didn't already know, being a software engineer for 5 years.\nI'd also have expected the course to also go into modern architectural topics, such as Clean Code and SOLID principles.",

            review: "This was my 8th course in the program and I took this class as an easy A to pair with another class.\nOverview:\nWell structured course about software architecture and general design principles of software systems.\nAssignments:\n7 total including one group project and group review. The indivudal assignments are very straight forward and take anywhere from 30 minutes to a few hours (for the initial project implementation - ~5-10 hours with strong java skills). The group project is a lot more substantial but can be done in ~20 hours assuming you start from a good code base (you pick one members individual project and work from there) and have a solid plan for how to implement new features. The biggest part that added time to the group project was actually working with other people. A single person could do all the work in half the time of the group but that's not how it works in the real world.\nQuizzes:\nBased on the lectures and reading. Very easy, no trick questions. You should probably do the reading before taking the quiz but its not always necessary.\nLectures:\nWell structured and informative. Honestly only watched a few of them but they seemed good.\nExams:\nNone!\nOverall:\nYou can get a lot out of this class if you've never worked in the industry. If you have, you will be bored. There is a TON of overlap with CS 6300 (software development process). You can easily get an A with no more than an hour or two per week but every so often you will be in the 10-20 hr range depending on your familiarity with java and how good your group is. Personally, I took this course as an easy A to pair with something else because I'm kind of burnt out after 2 semesters doubling up + summers. I don't feel like I really got anything out of the class that I didn't from CS6300, but I could have.",

            review: "One of the more enjoyable courses in my journey.\nThis class has gotten a lot of positive and negative reviews over the years.  Professor Moss is doing a great job with it right now.\nThere are six assignments.\n\nA background survey\nUML Diagram\nPeer Review of the UML diagram\nImplementation of the program\nGroup project enhancement write up\nGroup Project delivery\n\nThere are six quizzes.  Lowest is dropped.  Two attempts per.  Mostly true/false.\nI put 6 hrs week workload.  It was less than that for A1,2,3,5, but significantly more for A4 and A6.  You can't really work ahead, but this would pair great with a class that you can work ahead in.\nThe enjoyment in this class comes from the fact that there are so many ways to do things right in software design.  (There are also a lot of ways to do it wrong.)  You work on one project the whole way through, getting a six page list of requirements to start.  You create a UML diagram outlining this project, then peer review three other students in the second assignment.  I had two meaningful sets of feedback and one kid who either didn't know what was going on or didn't care.  The individual implementation was more of a refactoring exercise.  The staff presented us with a monolithic version of the program that we had to re-engineer into an object oriented program in java.  If you don't know Java, there is plenty of time in the first couple of weeks to brush up.  Plus, they hand you a working version of the program, you just have to move things around and make it OOP.\nThere are a lot of complainers about too much UML.  These people are missing the point.  In software design, you have to document your system in much detail.  There are several ways to do this.  This course focuses on UML because the resources are readily available and it makes grading uniform and consistent.\nWord to the wise: find your group early in the semester.  Other people who are go-getters will be doing the same.  I had a great group of three and everyone contributed and even finished early.\nThe final assignment was the bulk of the time spent in the semester.  We implemented a database, gui and security.  It did take a strong effort to get it all working together and working right, but we had the people to do it.\nTL;DR I remember a fella named Chuck Cottril on Google Plus who said this class was YAGNI (you aint gonna need it.) While you don't need it, it was a great exercise in java, teamwork, and software design.  The new skills I learned were what we implemented in the group project, so choose your enhancements on what you want to learn.",

I think UML is a good guideline of making diagrams for a business setting but the strict rules are useless and shouldn't be a focus.\nI would have preferred more focus on design patterns and things like studies into monolith structure to micro services and things of this nature, but none of this is ever addressed really. If you need an easy A then make sure to choose your group for the final project wisely and put in a decent effort.\nThe TAs are pretty good and responsive, especially for the final project. I'm not sure if it was just the summer but we didn't know half of our grades until the class was over which I'm sure could cause problems for some.\nFor some background I started as a CS undergrad and finished CIS, and I took a course similar to this there. I already had knowledge of UML and so this class was mostly useless for me, but if you have no experience in UML then it's a nice thing to know. It does require Java programming which I have almost no experience in, but you can google your way through that if you have any programming experience at all really.",

I was also hoping it would cover how to not only design from a \"green field\" state,  but also how to approach applying modern design to legacy code. It did not. There wasn't much substance to this course, just plenty of diagrams to draw. You do need to be able to actually write Java code to complete the project(s). In addition getting a good team together for the final project is important for success. The one positive I can say about the class is that I found the TA's very active on Slack and Piazza.

Lectures touch briefly on Object Oriented Design Patterns and fundamental concepts like coupling and cohesion and avoiding monolithic structures. All good but basic concepts that are 20+ years old. I was expecting a lot more from a graduate level course on Software Architecture from a top ten CS program like GaTech.\nYou get what you put in, but it is an easy A even if you don't put in too much. The projects can be fun if you approach them that way. There is a major noticeable gap between experienced students and those without any professional software engineering experience so you'll probably learn more from other students than you will from the course itself if you are active and engaged.",

A lot of grade on drawing diagram and reviewing other people's work, so even if I took 6300 when I know nothing about programming I received much higher grade in 6300 than this one.\nLectures are dull, however the latter part of lectures are fun to my surprise.",

You won't learn much.\nTake this class if you are looking for an easy A.\nGreat teaching team and well structured class!\nProfessor Moss is very involved in office hours and personally responds to many Piazza posts.\nTAs are responsive on Piazza.\nNo active slack group.\nThere is a group project in this course (last 4 weeks of the class). You can pick your own team so going into the class with a team helps. Having someone with front end experience helps as the group project has a backend and front end (GUI/webpage/mobile app) component.\nAssignment instructions were very detailed and easy to understand. Very few clarifying questions required.\nThe bulk of the coursework is with the group project (last ~4-5 weeks of the course). The rest of the semester is pretty light with assignments taking ~5-10 hours each) and quizzes taking ~1 hour per attempt (open book).\nNo exams!!!!\n\nQuizzes\n\n6 quizzes, open book. Based on obscure knowledge from readings/papers. Open book, 4 attempts.\n2 CATME surveys - First one is for team formation (~15 min to fill out) and second one is for team member assessment (~30 min to fill out). Make sure to leave detailed comments about each team members contribution.\n\nAssignments\n\nAssignment 1: CATME survey\nAssignment 2: Course project design - The whole class is based on a designing a system. When I took it, the project was to design a star search simulation system. Create UML diagram and sequence diagram for A2. Time Required: ~10 hours. This is not difficult but it does take some time to read the instructions and come up with a good design.\nAssignment 3: Peer review - Review 3 students's designs and diagrams and leave feedback based on specific format specified in the instructions. Time Required: ~8 hours. This is not difficult but it does take some time to review other diagrams and provide useful feedback.\nAssignment 4: Initial implementation of the system: Java coding, starter code given. Have to change this from monolithic to OOP design. Time Required: ~10 hours. Assignment instructions state all the requirements. 10 test cases given, TAs will test with about 20 more. You aren't graded on the efficiency of your search algorithm though so a basic brute force ish algorithm is good enough.\nAssignment 5: Group Project Improvements; Write up a proposal with 3 system improvements. Time Required: ~5 hours (most of which will go into discussing and detailing improvements with your teammates).\nAssignment 6: Simulation Coding - Add 3 improvements on top of A4 code. Usually groups will just pick one team members code to go off. GUI was required in the past but was not required this term so it counted as one improvement. Sample improvements: Data persistence, rewind/forward actions, adding other objects in the search region, search region object fueling/fuel capacity. Time Required: ~30 hours (+/- depending on how well your group works together). We used github issues to track bugs and assign tasks.\n",

I think the class is well designed to teach Objected Oriented Design and software architecture concepts. The class seems well-staffed with TAs this semester, with both the Prof and TAs working hard to ensure the class can continue despite difficult circumstances. Moreover, they are very active on Piazza and are patient with students' questions.\nThe course materials teaches software engineering and architectural concepts that are relevant til today. The textbook teaches Object Oriented Design through UML, design pattern applications, and is written by Craig Larman, a computer scientist who contributed much to the computer science and agile community.\nThe material was also supplemented with interesting readings on clean code, and design patterns such as the GoF. The Prof also makes a point to hold reading discussions to discuss the topics at length.\nThe assignment is also designed to apply what you have learned. I think the assignment instructions could have been clearer to minimize repeated questions on the forums though.",

            review: "The course is comprised of the following:\n\n8 Assignments\n\n2 - 7 focus and build iteratively on the lawn mower simulation, culminating in the group project to implement a GUI\n1 and 8 are CATME surveys\n\n\n6 Quizzes\nParticipation\n\nAssignments\n1: Catme Survey\n2: Initial mower design - UML diagrams and Q/A\n3: Initial mower implementation - Coding\n4: Mower modifications - UML diagrams and Q/A\n5: Peer reviews of Assignment 4\n6: Software architecture paper\n7: Group mower implementation - Coding\n8: Catme Survey\nAs seen above, there is a stark lack of programming in this course. It largely consists of reading dated literature and writing-based assignments. The first coding assignment wasn't until 6 weeks into the course, and the final was due nine weeks later -- that's all the code you'll write in this class.\nQuizzes\nThere are 6 quizzes in the course, and they almost exclusively focus on Larman's Applying UML and Patterns book. This book was originally published in 1997, and it has not aged well. How someone managed to write 600 pages on UML practices and specification without losing their mind is astonishing.\nI was able to take each multiple-choice quiz without any preparation or studying, by simply ctrl+f'ing through the PDF while I took the quiz. You have 4 tries for each quiz, but you get no intermediate score or indication if you missed anything or got anything right. Ultimately, I retook each quiz and just switched answers for questions I wasn't able to find verbatim in the PDF.\nI would avoid using O'Reilly all together as their search function does not work well. You're better off finding the PDFs. Again, you'll occasionally need to read another paper, but I think each quiz had some non-trivial amount of questions from the Larman book.\nFinal Project\nThe group project is just another iteration of the mower simulation with some changed requirements. We all took the Catme survey at the start of the course, but group creation is a complete free-for-all. Either you have some buddies to group with, or you're choosing/joining groups at complete random. This led to a group with disparagingly wide range of skills and motivations. Unless you get really lucky, you'll likely end up doing the final in Java and some sort of GUI on top of that (Swing). You're limited by needing to package the final on a Linux VM, and the common denominator language of having done a lot of pre-work in Java in Assignment 3.\nYou're technically allowed to do anything within the VM (web-based, etc.), but, again, this depends on your group competencies and motivation.\nThis was ultimately a really poor experience in sloppily copying and pasting code from individual's assignments.\nUdacity\nThe videos associated with this course are honestly embarrassing. They're extremely outdated, the quizzes are broken and non-engaging, and the production quality is really poor compared to some other courses.\nOverall\nThis course was a huge disappointment. I got an A in the class, and I never did more work than a couple hours the day before an assignment was due. The final project took some coordination, but you're working with other remote students -- your luck will be hit or miss here. In retrospect, I'm truly shocked that this is a Master's-level course. I was expecting a deep-dive into hands-on design patterns and larger architectural implementations in various languages, cloud-based workflows and distributed design. Instead, you'll simply read dated books on UML specifications and horribly dated opinions on what it means to be a Software Architect.\nHonestly, skim through one of the required readings and Google each \"expert's\" name. Most of the people featured in this book can't even submit a proper, clear headshot of themselves, much less provide any meaningful opinion on software architecture -- this is just full of self-stroking egos.\nI suggest taking this course as an easy A and double it with something else to get ahead in the program.",

Hands-on work track and Reading/Quiz track.\nAssignments include\n\nCatme survey - Yes there is a weightage given. So please take this survey\nInitial analysis and design of the system\nIndividual implementation of the system - skeletal monolith code is given. Make it more modular and add some algorithm. Algorithm effectiveness carries a good weightage\nUpdate the design based on new requirements and changes to design while coding\nDo a peer review of the design\nDo a group project with new requirements added\nDo one more catme survey\n\nThe design of this is based on how software evolves in real world, with new requirements coming in all the time.\nThere are 6 quizzes and best 5 out of 6 quizzes will be taken. Each have 4 attempts. Highly recommend reading the required readings and attending the office hours (or watching recordings) and getting clarity on the questions. There is a wealth of information in those sessions\nThere is one position paper to be written based on the book 97 things every architect should know. You get what you put in. There is a lot to gain from this course if you are ready to engage.\nOnly negative I see is with the time taken for grades to be turned around. At the course withdrawl date, there was about 35% of the grades turned around. It becomes a guesstimate to drop at that point. At the course end date, and the official grade submission deadline, about 60% of the individual grades were returned. 40% - group project, position paper and participation grades were not returned till the letter grade submission deadline. Students got their letter grades prior to the individual marks.\nGrading in this course is very very fair and thorough. So this is really understandable that instructors take a little longer to finish grading. Lot of posts on piazza at the end of the course was about the grades not being there in place.\nThis is something that they should improve in the next term.',

The quizzes focus on reading from different books (primarily Larman's book Applying UML and Patterns) and answering questions in an open-book format. Lectures are of varying quality and I found myself drifting off. About halfway through I stopped watching the lectures and just focused on the readings.\nThe assignments were more interesting. They involved creating documentation and implementing a Java app for a toy problem (search on youtube for some examples of previous semesters projects). One of my favorite assignments was writing a response papers to two articles from a book on software architecture problems.\nThe group project is re-doing the individual assignment with some added requirements and complexity (primarily adding a GUI front-end, either through a browser or using Swing/FX). This will vary depending on your group but isn't too hard especially if you did well on the individual project(and my group was excellent)\nOverall this is a great class to take if you are interested in software engineering. Some of the topics may be dry but thinking through  and critiquing designs will help improve your design skills. You will learn more UML than you need to but have a better idea of design-related challenges when writing software.",

            review: 'The class wasn’t too difficult, but the topics felt a bit bland. It felt more like a reading course than programming course. There was a lot of material/topics to read through, and you had to take quizzes on them. The quizzes are open-book, though, so fortunately, you don’t have to memorize hundreds of pages every week. It’s on a similar realm to the SDP course in that it touches on design diagrams, the programming projects are in Java, and there’s a final group project. I did not like this course as much as I did SDP, though. The lectures and readings went really deep into design in software architecture, and they felt a bit disjointed from each other. The course isn’t hard but does require a non-trivial amount of time and dedication to complete the lectures, reading, quizzes, and assignments.\nWhile I don’t particularly enjoy group projects, I think the group project is structured a bit better for this course than SDP. Most of the work for the group project is already completed in previous individual assignments, so for the group project, you’d be smart to just build on what you already had. For SDP, the group project was almost from scratch, so there was a lot of work to do.\nOverall, the main way to be successful in this course is to stay on top of the work every week and keep a good schedule.\nThere were a few downsides to the course. Firstly, due to the sheer size of the class and the nature of the assignments (conceptual, as opposed to pure programming), the teaching staff had a really hard time keeping up with the grading. By the time grades were due for the semester, we were still missing grades from 3 (out of 8) of the assignments. Secondly, grading feels quite... subjective. I had a fantastic group that was goal-oriented and talented. We combed through the requirements with a fine-toothed comb and made sure we checked everything off. We had points deducted for parts of the assignment that did not have concrete specifications---the reason being that it wasn\'t "enough", and that things could\'ve been "better." Overall, the final project grade was really excellent and our team members received A\'s for the class (i.e. there was no point in asking for a regrade), but it was a bit frustrating to see points taken off for seemingly subjective reasons. I personally did not feel like the structure of the class really offered ways to effectively enhance students\' understanding of the material. Particularly, I didn\'t really feel like I became a better software architect as a result of this course. All in all, I would say that if you\'re looking for a relatively "easy" class to get an A and to tick off a foundational course, this is one of those.',

            review: "I did not like this class.  It was more a class on how to write UML which I have never seen used in a company setting ever other than very basic uses.  So the lectures feel a little outdated.  Additionally, the lecturer, who is now retired I believe so they have others running the class now, is very dry and not fun to watch.  He has a student with him in many lectures that he asks questions to but he is always correcting the kid and making him look stupid.  I just felt bad for the kid most of the time and felt like the lecturer was being overly critical.\nThe group assignment was unpleasant, especially because only half of us really wanted to get the assignment done well and on time.  Two of us stayed up until 3 AM pulling it together because other people dropped the ball.  The assignment was interesting enough, but the design of the code we were given was really strange and hard to work with. You'd think a class about good architecture would try to be a good example and give you a solid code base to work with...\nOverall I disliked it.  The assignments were incredibly tedious and mostly about doing UML graphs, not in coming up with good designs.  I took 6300 which is very similar and I felt like I learned most of the same stuff (sans UML, thank goodness) and with a way better lecturer.  I recommend you take that class instead.\nThankfully I did learn about TDD for the last assignment and that I did use later.",

            review: "After having taken SDP and this course, I would take SDP and skip this.  This course covers OOA in depth.  SDP touched on the entire development process which is useful anywhere but many environments would never delve into UML like you do in this course.  You will spend a lot of time creating and reviewing UML documents.  The main project was interesting but too  much time was spent covering the semantics of the project and not on the material the of the course.  Agile development was a topic but was not covered as well as I expected I think because of the focus on project requirements.  It's a useful course that may be good for you to organize and document your concepts, but its not my favorite.",

            review: 'Software Architecture and Design consists of 6 open book quizzes and 6 assignments.\nThe quizzes cover the following topics:\nHonor Code, Plagiarism and Collaboration Awareness,\nSoftware Engineering Body of Knowledge Software Design,\nUnified Modeling Language (UML),\nArchitectural Styles and Models,\nDesign Patterns and Related Issues and Software Design Principles.\nThe assignments are the core of the course. Currently, this course uses an object oriented coding project (a simulation for mowing grass using multiple lawnmower robots) which is used throughout with additions/updates as the term progresses.\n\nInitial Analysis and Design: Read the problem prompt and submit a UML diagram and description of how to solve it.\nIndividual Implementation: Use Java to code a solution. Monolithic starter code is given, but the solution should be object oriented.\nDesign Updates/Modification: Additional specifications for the project are given. More documentation is required including a class diagram, sequence diagram and description.\nDesign Peer Review: Submit an analysis of the work of 3 students from the prior assignment. Comments should connect directly to topics discussed in class.\nArchitecture and Design Position Paper: Write responses to a few opinion articles about the role of software architects.\nGroup Project: Choose a group and implement the final version of the problem. Requires source code/VM, GUI, 4 diagrams and a 10 minute video demonstration.\n\nOffice Hours, Reading Reviews, Udacity Videos, Piazza round out the learning experience. Overall, this class is well organized, but you can decide on the amount of effort you put in since many aspects of the course (readings/videos/office hours) are essentially optional as tests are not given.',

For those of you who haven't worked together with other folks you don't know, this is a learning experience. People admitted to OMSCS program are generally very smart, so once I worked out the communication barriers, it went smoothly. Grading is on the generous side as long as you are following instructions and keeping to the point. Even though I went in thinking why I needed to learn UML, I ended up learning about software design patterns (things you don't do at work). Therefore I personally think it added some value in the end.\nCons: The lectures are extremely boring and the material needs update. There are way too many lectures, can be condensed and too much emphasis on OCL/UML. There could have been a better focus on design patterns, case studies of famous software projects, etc.",

We received 1% Extra Credit as 76% of students completed the survey.\nThere was also an additional 0.5% Extra Credit for Individual coding project(Assignment-5) as there were additional test scenarios by mistake.\n1 individual coding assignment\n1 group project including both coding and UML diagrams\n\nCons:\n\nThere is not much correlation between assignments and lectures after UML\nMost of the assignments will be graded by one grader. If you are unlucky you may end up with one who does not pay attention to grading requirements such as essay length or provide feedback too late.\nOnly 2/10 assignments are coding related. Other assignments(70% of the grade) are UML diagrams,  essays or feedbacks.\nUML diagrams are heavily graded.\nThere were conflicting instructions as of when an assignment is due. One Instructor Piazza post said assignment 5 and 6 were due on the same day, though Canvas had different dates. The Piazza post was never updated. Students only need to follow Canvas due dates and announcements as it will supersede any Piazza/Office hour posts.\nOffice hours are great but can be lengthy and confusing. As a result, there are ~100 posts/updates just to clarify the "rewind" feature of the "Mass Transit System"\nThere are only 3 weeks for the group project which includes knowing your group members, analyzing each other\'s projects(5 and 6) to be used as the basis for the group project and deliver the final project, video presentation and working VM(Virtual Machine). This is especially difficult in Fall as members may be unavailable during Thanksgiving.\nIf you\'re unlucky, you may end up with group members who do not care to contribute or communicate and think they have already contributed by doing previous projects! You could easily see your time spent per week rise dramatically (~40hr/week) in the 1-2 weeks before the project deadline.\n50% of the grades (Assignment 7-10) were not released until 2-3 days before the official grades were due.\nJust choosing a group member based on location is not a great way to form a group. For group-project, make sure you have someone with FrontEnd experience.\n\nAlso, remember to submit all files for an assignment every time. There were many students who only submitted all required files the first time, but then only resubmitted an updated file and not the other one. For instance, if you have 2 files to submit, resubmit both every time even if only one of them is updated. As a result,  Canvas only had some of the required files.\nThough it is an easier course, it may take more time than you think.',

Although if you've taken 6300, you probably won't learn much here (especially, as there are no tests, you don't even need to watch all the course material)\nThe course material is not hard, the management somehow makes the course very hard.\nFor example, in the major individual coding assignment, the advisor noticed there are errors (more like inconsistency, the VM uses one printout format, the PDF uses another) in the examples one month before the deadline, this is what they did to notify the students\n\n\nreplied in a piazza post, which is either pinned or highlighted and by the time it's approaching the deadline (approximately a month from the post), it is already deeply buried by other posts\n\n\nPost an announcement titled  \"New Prototypes and Test Solutions Available\"- Looks like the instructor is posting new tests, right? in the body the instructors say \"There was an error with the testing prototypes: they displayed the correct values on the screen.\" I skipped the content after skimming the title and\n\n\nThe PDF requirement asks the students to use the VM to test their code (which intended as the VM environment, not the wrong tests in VM). There were no red bold reminders or corrections in PDF, nothing.\n\n\nThe error was founded one month before the deadline, and the error was not corrected.\n\n\nI met 3 other students in the later group project, who I didn't personally know before the group formation. And 3 out of 4 of us used the VM test cases as the standard and lost 40-50% points.\nThis is very sad and frustrating  for us as a student",

            review: "I don't think this course is run very well, and most of my issues come from the TAs/instructor and the group project.\nIf you have experience reading/writing Java, you're fine. 3-4 of the assignments are text based (reading and writing). 2 of the projects are designing UML documents. 2 of the projects (the individual project halfway through and the group project at the end) are coding projects (Java). As I mentioned, any experience in Java (especially with writing multi-class OO apps) will be fine.\nThe TAs and instructor didn't answer questions often, instead referring to minute marks in the office hours. I understand why you'd encourage students to watch office hours, but a lot of us just want to see the answer we're looking for instead of sitting through 1-2 hours a week of office hours, or scrubbing a video. It just seemed somewhat passive aggressive. The readings are useless. They assign them and hold \"reading hours\", but they aren't necessary at all. The only benefits from the lectures are to take the quizzes for the participation points. Aside from that, you can Google/learn as you go the UML concepts you need.\nThe group project is a typical group project. I didn't particularly care for it, as my group wasn't great (had a major imbalance in ability and workload). The individual project isn't too tough, I am moderately experienced with Java and it took me about 7-8 hours total over a week or so. The text-based projects (including an essay) are boring and didn't seem to actually grow knowledge in the subject.\nOverall, I don't think this course is the standard of what I'd expect in OMSCS. Most of the assignments feel like busy work. I also personally don't care for software dev concepts (such as UML design), but that's on me. I'd say SDP is a much superior course. If you're looking for an elective or a course in the computing systems track, try one of the others before this one. However, this course was fairly trivial over the course of the semester, so if you just need a \"filler\" class, then this is fine.",

We got to pick our own teams.  To be honest, I felt like I learned a significant amount from my team member than anything else in this class.  The team project is a decent size project so make sure you're on the ball about picking good team members.  I watched to see who was more active on Piazza and who provided good feedback or had decent backgrounds in the field and then asked to team with them.  Worked out great.  The professor held weekly office hours and answered questions on Piazza.  TA's were active as well.  I guess some of the information is a little outdated like the UML stuff but honestly its just another form of documentation and it didn't seem to egregious to me.",

            review: 'This was my second course in the OMSCS program. I had taken IOS(CS6300) in Spring2018 prior this class. Coming from such a great class IOS was, this class was terrible. It is easy to get an A but I did not get very much learning out of it, which is why I am doing this program in the first place. On weeks when assignment was due, you can cram it out and on other weeks that don\'t have anything due, there would be almost no work except watch some videos. There was a lot of cramming in the end for the final project. Here is the break down:\nPros:\n\nEasy to get an A\nNo exams so don\'t need to stress over material of the lectures\nCan kind of BS your way through since design is very subjective and there is never a "right" answer\n\nCons:\n\nTA\'s are not very helpful AT ALL, rarely answers piazza posts clearly or even at all. There is no slack channel for concept discussion and questions.\nAssignments take a LONG time trade. Since it takes forever for you to get your assignment back, and even when you do get it back, you don\'t get any feedback so you don\'t know if what you did was actually correct or not, even though you got a decent grade. Because of that, I went through the entire course not knowing what things I did right or wrong. Up to this point I still do not know what I did for my assignments were correct or not, it was all "my best guess, and what made sense for me", but it would be very helpful to see other ways of doing the assignments, what to do and what not to do.\nFinal project was just kind of thrown at you and he tells you to just go do it. There is no progression or guide in how to do the project so it is overwhelming at first, especially if you don\'t have very experienced team members. Also absolutely no feedback for our final project. We spent 85% of our time doing the database which was worth 15 points and we ended up getting 0/15 for some unknown reason. We message the TA and professor and we get no response. It is just so unprofessional.\nLecture materials apparently are very important concepts but videos do not go over many examples or go in depth to explain anything, how to implement concepts, how the concept compares to another solution. The professor presents the material and thats it. If someone like me has never heard or ever seen what the professor is talking about, I do no learning.\n\nTips:\n\nTry to meet up with local students and discuss over topics in lectures and homework requirements (of course following the collaboration policy). This is because design is very subjective. There is never a "right" way to design something. That is what makes the course content difficult to learn.\n',

This is the first OMSCS course where I didn't finish all of the videos. In fact, you don't even need to watch the videos to successfully complete all of the assignments.\nThere are some great courses in OMSCS. Until this one is reworked, it isn't one of them.

That said, having some way to organize your design graphically turns out to be very useful, and it's all the more so if it's a system that's consistent enough to be easily gradable. But the real reason to take this class is the dive into design patterns. You won't have to, necessarily. I think you only have to compare and contrast 4 for the final paper, but having an environment where you have time set aside to really explore different ways of solving problems (and people standing by to answer your questions) turns out to be pretty valuable in the long run.",

Group project towards the end of the semester is interesting, but if you find yourself in a bad team you may be in trouble as the team project accounts for 20% of your entire grade. Also on grading, it took the teaching body a long time to grade assignments, which can be a problem as, since some of the assignments sort of build on each other, if you make mistakes on an early assignment, you may get penalized for the same mistake on a later assignment. However, grading seemed very reasonable and methodical overall. It was my first course on the program, and one I thought to be a good intro to it after the fact. Probably worth taking it, but don't expect much learning if you work as a SW engineer on your day job; however, as others already alluded to, it is a Graduate course and you get what you put in.",

There are some assignments that don't take much time but there are others that do if you want to get top marks. If your goal is to get the highest grade possible then be prepared to put some time into this course but if all you want to do is pass then this course probably won't require too much. This is grad school so at the end of the day you get out what you put in.",

Not too difficult, some projects to help get you into the flow of school again (for those of us who last attended school ages ago). The group project was the hardest part, mainly because of getting everyone on the same page and being able to do the requirements on time (there was a lot of wasted time on our part organizing and scheduling). I highly recommend when you get a new project to start right away as the projects always seemed to take longer then one would expect.',

            review: "This class is probably a good first class or one to save to take with another class.  No tests, and most of the work towards the end.  I wrote 5 hours/week here but I am not sure how much it actually was, since I basically just completed every assignment the weekend (day) before it was due.  The group project was the only thing that required scheduling, but if you have a good group like I did then it's not a problem; plus it was an obscenely small % of the total grade.  The periodic assignments, class participation, and peer feedback was a large percentage, and they were very manageable.\nThis class went through the motions hitting all the key beats, but focusing mostly on UML class diagrams and state charts.  It then touched on and required us to generate behavior diagrams and a deployment diagram.  There were periodic assignments requiring various diagrams to be generated for various designs, and then there was a group project.  The group project was based on a scenario described in a prior assignment, so the initial work consisted of reviewing the group members' class diagrams and code and combining all the best parts (or picking someone's who got a good grade).  All of that was fine.\nThen there was a surprisingly large amount of coding.  It was my first time having to write Java in 10 years or so, and I was surprised, considering design can 100% be done without writing code.  Either way, as you can see from my rating, it was pretty easy overall, but I would just be warned that there is significant coding required.  Also the videos were weird; I didn't think they were bad at the time, but having taken a couple more classes since I can see they weren't great.  Also, they didn't always have anything to do with what we were actually generating for the assignments and the project, but the state chart ones were OK.",

The grades come back kind of slowly, but as long as you break the problem down and model it correctly you won't have any issues.

I'd think that both professor and TA's could have participated much more actively in Piazza, as it was usually necessary to wait till office hours to get responses to some of most straightforward questions, even questions about logistics and organization.\nThe unpleasant surprise, however, was that the group project, which was supposed to be most highly weighted in the overall grade, was never actually scored (or perhaps it was scored, but score was not disclosed to the students?). Eventually, I of course did get the overall grade for the course at the required deadline, so I thought the project grade is just a little bit delayed, but up to this moment I still see neither grader comments, nor the score for the main project. Don't know if I just missed it somehow. Perhaps other folks could chime in if that is indeed the case.",

You work through building out an application from the requirements stage -> initial individual implementation -> expansion of requirements -> expanded group implementation. This process is incredibly helpful as it presents things that you do in the real world.\nWhat I didn't like was the weight put on sticking to OOP principles throughout the process. While the instructors have to pick some sort of way of evaluating code, picking specific programming paradigms/features cause problems as it is outside the stated goals of project architecture/documentation/design/implementation. That said, if you have any sort of OOP background you should be OK in this course (another important piece of info is this course is very much a \"do your assignments in Java\" course).\nI got the feeling that this course is somewhat evolving and some of the lecture material isn't useful for the full implementation of the projects.

The last piece of the project turns into a group project and you have to merge each members ideas/work together or start from scratch. I think this was one of the ONLY group projects I have enjoyed, mostly because everyone knew what they were doing and actually did the work. It was spectacular. Hardest part for me was some of the diagrams you have to build. A few of them didn't really have good samples so I had to do some comparison from the real world examples I could find and hope it correlated back to what was expected in the class.\nSoftware Architecture and Design is what I do for a living, so this class was a breeze for the most part. Completely forgot to turn in one of the projects (wrong date on my calendar, lost 15% of my grade right of the bat) and still got an A. Before this class I had a rather strong hatred for Java.

Piazza forums was active and the TA were really engaged in answering the questions. This helps a lot in the assignment because the feedback for your submission might not be delivered on time for you to work on the next task (and most of the assignments are basically refinement of previous assignment).\nSomething that I think might be improved is to include modern architecture like microservices or SOA and more examples on the popular frameworks/tools for the implementation.

The course took you through design and implementation of a Java application. Therefore, you certainly need to be able to program a working basic application that will become more complex as it shifts to the group stage of the course.\nMy only disappointment with this class is that if you were unsure of a direction you were working towards in your design, you would not get feedback for several weeks which is after the next assignment or two were due. They are very clear that you won't get marks off for repeat offenses in the case you didn't get feedback; however, from a learning perspective, this impacted my ability to learn through the feedback while working on the project throughout the course.",

If you aren't very experienced with programming in general, I feel that this is a nice starting point to practice these concepts and learn in a very practical way.\nThe only downside were the lectures, which I didn't find too interesting, nor did they help me too much with the project per-se, except for a few ones that talk about UML Class Diagrams and others that talk about converting requirements to classes and methods.\nIn summary, this is a good starting point if you aren't too experienced with programming. If you are, but want to start off the OMSCS with a not-too-difficult class just to get an idea of how the whole program runs, this is a good option as well. However, I wouldn't suggest it to an experienced software engineer. For those students, there are other courses in the OMSCS that would teach them more useful things.",

Regrade requests are entertained but usually doesn\'t change anything.

In my own experience as a software engineer, it has been sufficient to simply be on the same page as business partners and make sure you understand their requirements. Regular code reviews with senior team members and architects would help to ensure proper code design and quality. I have never once had the need to "translate" requirements into any kind of UML diagram. The assignments had a lot of "busy work" around this UML and in one case there was even an essay portion to discuss the pros and cons of various architectural styles. I actually found that useful despite it being a bit tedious.\nHaving coded in Java for many years between school and work, I found the coding assignments to be a breeze. Having the last two assignments be group projects really didn\'t help matters. I went all out on the last assignment to make sure the team would get high marks, even though I didn\'t need them. The last assignment was valued at only 100 points (10% of grade) but I feel like it should have been a lot more given the amount of effort that was required to complete it.\nThe lectures weren\'t particularly engaging and there was a requirement to complete all the quizzes in them to get full participation marks. After the first few lectures that introduce the student to UML and OCL, I didn\'t feel like I needed the knowledge provided in them to complete the assignments. Indeed, I watched the first two and a half parts, then never watched them again until I had completed all the assignments (only to get the participation points). In the end, it was a very average course for me. Not particularly bad, but not great either.',

            review: 'There were 6 assignments (4 individual and 2 group). Your overall grade is based on these assignments and class participation (completing all quizzes and actively on piazza). I took a Software Design course during my undergrad and as expected this went more in depth than my undergrad but not as much as one would think. The videos were well put together but after the initial assignments did not have relevance to the course. I liked the idea of the assignments taking you through a realistic software design and implementation case. Each assignment built off of the previous one as far as requirement modifications by the client with the final assignment ending with the product that you slowly designed throughout the semester.\nI rated this class low because I think the class was harder than it needed to be. There were 3 issues I had throughout the semester:\n\n\nFeedback (aka grades) was delayed throughout the semester. The assignments were ordered as design1 --> implementation1 --> design2 --> implementation2 --> finaldesign3 --> finalimplementation3. The issue is we turned in design2 and implementation2 without feed back from the 1st assignments. This was an ongoing issue. HOWEVER, i will be FAIR and say that instructors were very active on Piazza.\n\n\nGrading was vague and seemed to vary alot between TAs. The instructors manually graded the 1st assignments but then used an autograder for assignment2 implementation. However, they did not provide us the test suite they used for the grading until afterwards. This seemed unfair and led to much controversy in the class.\n\n\nI found that most of my time was spent coding rather than focusing on the best design. In fact, UML design patterns were not emphasized at all in this course and due to the feedback we were not sure whether our design was okay until late in the semester. I do appreciate the instructor giving us the opportunity to code a little more but it was almost too much for a course that should be about design.\n\n',

The good thing is that unlike some other courses, you can choose your team members. The exam is straightforward as long as you watched the lectures, or did the assignments. The second project was pretty nice, since it allowed you to develop a whole system, and allowed the students to work with many different components and languages, which I found useful. The biggest annoyance with the projects is that they require you to interact with a Gurobi which is very poorly documented and hard to use. I spent more time in this course learning that Gurobi than I did doing anything else. That being said, you can pass this course or get an A, as long as you put in the time and the work.',

            review: "This course - at its core - teaches two things:\n\n\nthe syntax and conventions of UML diagrams: class, sequence, state chart make up the major players. Other diagrams get supporting roles.\n\n\nthe taxonomy of architectural patterns that arose as software systems and their teams became larger over the history of the industry\n\n\nIt delivers on those two fairly well. However the standout feature of the course, to me, was ILP (integer linear programming) with the commercial-grade solver Gurobi. I knew nothing about ILP and now I can't get enough. I have an extensive Java background, so learning \"ILP in Java\" meant one new thing paired with one old thing. NC State University hosts a large library of Gurobi code samples in multiple languages. Find them!\nEvery silver cloud must have a dark lining, so caveats from my view:\n\n\ngrades focus on the syntax of your diagrams, not the quality of the architecture expressed. I got all points on syntax-perfect diagrams of ideas I considered underwhelming.\n\n\nin summer, grading took forever. I didn't get any informative grades until two days before the drop-with-W date. You cover half the courses' content before you get grades on the first real assignments.\n\n\nalso in summer, course staff did not assign any OCL homework, despite several hours of lectures and a reading on OCL in the syllabus. a one hour overview would suffice, without using OCL for any assignments where we can practice and receive feedback.\n\n\nanother summer specific comment: some assignment windows overlapped, including the final project.\n\n",

However, the programming projects were a bit more difficult and extremely time consuming, thus the reason for my higher average workload feedback. Mark Moss was a very good professor. He attended all office hours together with the TA's. TA's were also very responsive on Piazza as well, so support was easy to get if you asked for it. Projects were all java based which was nice because my Java background is lacking, so I was able to learn a new programming language as a result. In terms of project details, the first project was not team based and required decent knowledge of optimization concepts and the use of the Gurobi optimization framework. So you would be wise to brush up on Linear Programming optimization. Projects 2 & 3 were team based and as someone else mentioned on a different review, if you have a strong team, you will love this course! We had a diverse set of skills that allowed us to get very good grades on the projects, in addition to coming up with really cool designs and implementations. For our last project, we pretty much designed a full web based distributed application that utilized Vaadin (web gui), Spring (MVC framework), and the Gurobi optimizer. These are all technologies that I believe are used in the real world so I believe I can really apply what I have learned.",

Professor and TA's were very responsive on the Piazza forms, though they were at time slow on returning assignment and project grades as well as updating mistakes in the grading.\nOverall the workload depended on the week. When there were no projects released or assignments due, I would typically spend only a few hours a week. When a project was due, I would spend closer to 20 hours a week. I would recommend starting on projects when they are released, as if you do not, you will end up having to pull some late nights. The lectures were informative, but really did not cover what you needed to do on projects and assignments in great detail, though I think the professor's point that you cannot teach design through lectures is valid.\nThe one thing I really did not like about the course was the choice of technologies we had to work with. The projects involved implementing a tool called Gurobi, which is very poorly documented, and very hard to work with unless you understand what you are doing. For the first project especially, I spent at least 75% of my time trying to get Gurobi to work and 25% actually focusing on what the course teaches.",

There were three projects, all related to an application that needed to optimize the scheduling of classes. It was an exciting and challenging exercise. The final deliverable takes time, so start as soon as possible.\nThe final exam wasn't particularly complicated and it was open notes. You can pass it using the video lectures alone.

A normal week I probably spent about 10 hours, but weeks in which projects were due it was more around 20-25 hours. The material itself is not very difficult, and I enjoyed the subject topics covered. The lectures were very informative and to the point, though at times a bit dated. The professor states how it is hard to teach design, as design is best learned by doing. Yet most of the assignments were short 7 page research papers on various subjects, when smaller programming assignments or design problems would have been a better choice. I did learn a lot about the subject and thought it was well presented. That being said, I do have two major gripes about this course:\n\n\nFeedback and Grades. I understand that these large online classes tend to have a less than ideal student to grader ratio. But it took a VERY long time to get feedback on turned in assignments. Sometimes grades would come back without feedback, leaving me wondering why I got points off. There were several assignments that were not returned before the final exam or before the last project were due, which would have been extremely useful for the completion of those two. Throughout the semester it was hard, if not impossible, to tell how well you were doing because we didn't have any graded assignments returned, even though some were due 1+ months prior! The TAs also seemed to avoid questions on Piazza asking about when we would receive grades back, or just give an answer saying they did not know.\n\n\nGroup projects. BEWARE OF GROUP PROJECTS. The assignments for this class were mostly all done in groups. At the start of the semester the group forming process was not made clear whatsoever. We were asked to make 1 min long intro videos about ourselves and our experience, which I assumed would be used to help form groups. But we never saw them. When the first group assignment came out, we had to use Piazza to try to hastily form a group. And as it turned out, that was the group we had to use for the entire semester. If I had known that, I would have taken more care into the selection of my group members. Most of the assignments ended up being research papers, but the last major project required significant software development. KEEP THIS IN MIND WHEN SELECTING YOUR GROUP!! Other members of my group were not well versed in software development, while I am. This left me to do a huge portion of the project just due to time constraints and my previous experience. I honestly would have been better off doing it all myself. Keep this in mind if you take this course!\n\n\nOverall I give this course a 4/5. I enjoyed the material and learned a lot about software architecture and design. While time consuming, I enjoyed the class. Just learn from my naivety and be careful when selecting a group",

They are group assignments but because of the high number of students dropping out and people without a programming background you are lucky if you have 3 people working on the project. Compared to other high-workload classes, SAD isn't rewarding because I don't think that the material is all that interesting or useful (at least to me).",

            review: "Terrible class. Lectures are long, uninteresting and basically consist of a bunch of common sense that doesn't make sense. Assignments (which contribute only ~2% each to the course grade) are usually a 7 page paper and are group based and due a week after being assigned. There are 3 projects (each contributes 15% to the course grade) and you are assigned to a different group for each. Each project has 2 10 page papers plus the Java code for the project. There is no limit to the minutiae of detail on what is expected on each assignment and project. This might be considered a good thing, but it really isn't when the detail on the project changes during the course of the project and the format required on the papers isn't consistent with what the grading criteria are. Grades on the assignments and projects are not returned in a timely manner (they can't be given how involved the projects and assignments have to be). And even after the assignment or project is complete we have no idea of what would have received a 100% (no exemplars or even a diagram that works) - so how can we learn what to do better? Numerous classmates dropped the course which makes project completion even more difficult.\nSummary: Very time consuming and difficult - BY DESIGN.",

In addition, the first programming assignment was awful. It assumed a level of knowledge of Linear Programming that wasn't even hinted at in the prerequisites, and caused a huge amount of problems for students that couldn't interpret the requirements. The required papers were tedious as well. They all followed the same formula, and were harshly graded to strange standards. I really don't feel I learned anything at all from writing the papers.",

            review: "The projects in the course need to be restructured a bit. Too much emphasis on figuring out Physics-related requirements takes focus away from the project purpose of learning about Software Arch and Design. About 10% of project work was directly related to what we learnt in course. Rest of completely irrelevant. I thought the assignments were good. They reinforced things learnt in lectures. But they team based and that should not be the case. They are small enough for individual work. Plus the learing would be better if the entire assignment was done by a single person. Currently, sections of assignments are split up and you rarely get a full view of the topic at hand. Projects should be cut down in scope and grading emphasis should shift a bit more towards assignments.\nSince I had teammates who were in my timezone or in the zones at max 3 hours away, coordination wasnt really an issue. I am glad projects were team based since that is one way to meet other people in the course and learn from them.\nThe course has some great content like design patterns, design pricipiles and architectural styles. However, first section focuses on UML/OCL and pretty much everyone who had sw dev experience said that it is not very practical. We spent a lot of time on that in the course and during projects and it feels like a waste of time. Instead, if the lectures focuesd more on the other three topics I mentioned and go in depth about them, it will be useful. Some of the lectures on these topic were just 'read-a-list-from-telepromptor' type and that was really disappinting.\nWith some modifications, this can be a great course.",

            review: "If you like skeet shooting, take this class because the project instructions are a moving target. This is not a physics course, however much of the development time on the projects will be devoted to figuring out how to model heat diffusion. The instructor should provide code or a jar file that can be used to perform these arbitrary calcualtions so that the students can focus on the real goals of the projects which should be learning how to architect and design a system. The instructor expects perfect papers, yet his course material is riddled with errors. There is even a dedicated place on the class forums to report these 'bugs. ' The only positive aspect of this is that it counts for class participation. I found many of the problems I reported just by copying the instructions and doing a spell check in Word. I know of 2 students who dropped other courses and one who withdrew from school because of this class. If you take it, be ready for a roller coaster ride. I never realized how much stress and anxiety can produce physical symptoms until I went to the doctor and she said I was likely experiencing a rapid heart beat and night sweats because of this class. The best thing about the whole experience is that now I have a profound respect for those people who deal with panic attacks on a daily basis. Worst class I've ever taken. Constantly made me consider dropping out of school. I almost think he made it this hard on purpose so it can be a 'weeder' class. I can just imagine him leaning back in his office chair and grinning as the negative feedback surveys come rolling in. Despite all of this, if you have to take it, try not to stress too much becasue I think (hope) most students will end up with an A or B regardless of the actual grades. See his 'grading philosophy' at https://www. udacity. com/wiki/saad/faq. One other positive...

First, there should be fewer assignments, they should be shorter, and they should be individual. I say this because I know a limiting factor is the workload on the graders, so some combination of fewer/shorter assignments can result in them grading the same number of pages as they do with the current set-up. Second, the projects need to be set up in a way that recognizes teams do not meet in person, and that teams are comprised of a wider variety of CS backgrounds than one would find on the on-campus program. People without programming experience can't contribute to the code, nor can they contribute much to documents that require understanding of the code. Third, the administration of the final exam has been a disaster. More than a few lucky students have been allowed up to three hours to take the test by their proctors, while others given only 60 minutes. To do well in the course, you must have some lucky combination of getting assigned to the right project teams, getting assigned to a lax grader, and getting a proctor who gives you far more than the allotted time for the final exam.",

Thankfully, on each team I was on there was always a physics guy, which was invaluable. The assignments can easily be done on your own, but I believe the group requirement for the assignments was to make things easier on the markers. Coordinating a group on the assignments was trivial; however coordinating the group for the projects was decidedly more difficult. I had two great teams, and one bad team, but I wouldn't use that as a reason to get rid of the group work. I found the group work a great way to meet other people in the OMSCS program. The course web site states that you need to know how to program, and that there will be group work. A few small tweaks, and this course will be awesome.

            review: "I liked the lectures and readings, but wish we'd had a chance to explore some of the key subjects (such as design patterns) in more depth. Some of the best lectures were the ones that were more interview/interactive in nature. The team focused nature of every project AND every assignment means you'll spend a lot of time coordinating with other people. The projects (45% of the grade) were physics-focused and we had to spend a lot of time dealing with those aspects of the project, which distracted from time to focus on the software architecture. The final exam covers the entire course, so do yourself a favor and prepare study questions as you go so you don't have to re-review and cram the week before finals! Overall, you'll definitely learn a lot in the class, but some of this stuff has to soak in over time and experience. I think with some tweaks this course could be really great; there were definitely some frustrations (and that's perhaps the price we pay for being the first group to take it online) but I think they are serious about trying to solve those for the next offering.",
