            review: "I'm a SWE in big tech for 5 years now and I do have a background in engineering as well. I got a comfortable A.\nI waited till I had taken other courses before rating this course since it was the first one I took in the program. Now being on my 4th course, I think I can comfortably rate this course as my best course so far, by far.\nThe course is very well organized, from Ed discussions to Canvas. The material is fun and engaging, the projects are awesome, challenging and unique. The TAs are probably the best in the program you will ever come across. There's one particular TA, I don't want to name drop, but you'll know him when you see him if he's still there. Honest opinion, he is too good for that job. God bless him. He singlehandedly made the course so much fun with his tutorials.\nThe lead Prof. is pretty good as well at answering questions during OH. The key to this course is just to start early and try to finish the projects a week before the deadline. That way, if any project seems a bit too difficult, you have that extra time to work on it.\nI highly recommend.",

            review: "This was my first class in the program and I've really-really enjoyed it. I learned/recalled many interesting concepts (Kalman filter, particle filter, PID, SLAM, Search Algo's), the projects were interesting and well organized and the workload was reasonable. I wish all the OMCSC courses were like this one. After taking 3 courses in the program (the other two were KBAI and ML4T) I can tell that this one has yet been the best from the amount I learned vs. time and effort spent ratio.\nThere are plenty or rigorous reviews here already, so let me just say two things:\n\nDo yourself a favor and take this class - you will likely learn a lot without being overwhelmed.\nThe discussion board has been very helpful. Not once I was stuck on a project and sure enough, somebody was facing the same problem and already discussed it on Ed discussion.\n",

            review: "Based on the reviews here, I took the course and found it exciting just for a few days, but I regret. The assignments were challenging to understand and implement, and the TAs could have been more helpful. They usually replied with recommendations to read the entire Ed for every question. You can still pass it, but missing a project would be very costly, especially those two projects requiring so much dedication (3-4 full days/week). The lectures are from at least ten years ago and available on YouTube, but the projects would surprise you because they are released in order, and you have less time to learn in advance from YouTube or other AI tools. The Exams are close, and despite the different courses, you need help finding a single example code online. So, if you are a person who has done the assignments in the last few days, please don't worry about it.\nAnd about the contents, as I told you, the lecture is very old, and the methods could be more useful in the real world because they designed the assignment around their favorite gaming-like projects. So, you spend more time understanding their codes than learning the theory itself. I have an extensive background in robotics, sensors, data, and ML, and I have built several smart robotic control and hardware components; however, this course is far from robotics, except in the lectures in a very idealized way.\nOverall, I do not recommend the course at all. It is not going to add robotics to your skills.",

The projects are a lot of fun and very well made, even having cool visualizations for your code. They are all basically games where you try to beat a certain benchmark or accomplish a task.\nThe TAs were very knowledgeable and attentive. One TA, Chris, had the most amazing recorded office hours where he explained the projects and lecture concepts in great detail. They were super informative, and often the "ah-ha" moment I needed or provided key connections between lecture content and project requirements.\nOverall, I learned a lot, enjoyed the material and projects, and think the instructional staff did a great job.',

            review: "Video version: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBqIph_nwZM\nAI4R was my first class in OMSCS. I didn't have a CS undergrad and this course was a great introduction to the program. Some of the math concepts (probability and linear algebra) were challenging, but the actual programming (all Python) was not too difficult. Overall, it was one of the most fun classes that I took.\nThe course covers traditional AI techniques related to robotics like localization, mapping, path planning and SLAM. The best part of the class is the projects, which are very visual and provide a deeper understanding of the material. The lectures are also very good, but maybe a little too surface-level. With that being said, the professor and TAs are very active in the forum and provide supplemental material to help students complete the projects. The course is very well structured. The midterm and final were fair, and on the easier side.\nOne small complaint I have is that there was no mention of more modern techniques. A brief introduction to computer vision or deep learning at the end of the course would have made the course feel less outdated.",

            review: "This was my first course in OMSCS, and I felt it was a very good introduction. I got an A in this course, and enjoyed the course, with content including Kalman filters, kinematic bicycle motion (essentially some trig), histogram filters, particle filters, some search algorithms (policy, A*, etc.), SLAM. Would definitely recommend this class, especially as a first class. Exams are closed book, closed notes, straightforward, and not too difficult; I only spent a moderate amount of time to study for the exams.\nSome points that I noticed:\n\nLectures were engaging and informative, focusing on concepts and code application.\nCourse is not overwhelmingly challenging.\nProjects were fun and a great application of lecture material, while not being overly tedious or difficult. Some of the code can also be referenced from the lecture material, which provides a good starting point.\nExcellent TA's, the tutorial lectures by TA Chris were very helpful to get an intuitive understanding of the material and tips for application going beyond lecture material.\nLots of tweaking of certain parameters to achieve high marks on assignments.\nPotentially slightly outdated content, covering more traditional AI robotic topics.\nLectures alone will probably not be as helpful as the problem set lectures and TA Chris's tutorial lectures.\n",

The lectures were a bit outdated and I found Chris's tutorials to be more helpful. The projects were interesting and well put together, although most of them did require manual tuning to get full grades. You do get unlimited submission on the projects and the problem sets which is really helpful. I recommend starting the projects at least 2 weeks before they're due so that you have enough time to ask questions/tuning and not stress yourself last minute. The midterm and exam were okay, if you do well in the projects you don't need to worry too much about them as they're only worth 20% in total and you get 2 attempts. I studied for them 2 days in advance and was able to do well in them.",

However, I would say discussion boards with other students on best practices for projects is a huge time saver that I recommend. In addition, the exams test on a lot of material not covered in the outdated lecture series, so some adjacent research and practical application of the lecture materials in prep for exams in recommended. Ended the course with an A; 95%.",

I did learn a lot (there's only about 1/3 overlap with AI) but the code-style in the assignments and lectures really did not engage me. It felt like an engineering class shoehorned into Python - the lecture code uses some strange coding practices that make it really challenging to learn from. So, although I learned some great new concepts (Kalman Filters, SLAM, PID), I came away from the class frustrated at how clunky the code was to implement.",

I think the lectures were fairly straightforward and Dr. Thrun did a good job of taking a complex subject and teaching it in an accessible way.  Chris's tutorials were absolutely stellar as well!

            review: 'This course was my first in the program, and it was a great class to get back into school. For reference, my background is in aerospace engineering with a pretty good working knowledge of python and its various packages. I am married and working full time doing CV things (out of school for almost 4 years), but do not have a kid. So I have more free-time compared to a new parent who works full-time, but less\nFor me, I would say I averaged about 8 hours a week (maybe less). I had a couple of week I would do 10-20 hours, but more often I did not touch the course at all. It could also be completely front-loaded with all material being released in the first month-ish, and never touch it again except for the exams.\nI found the projects to be engaging and fairly intuitive. Sometimes the descriptions were poorly worded or sparse in areas that could use more description and wordy in areas that made it more complicated than it needed to me. However, nothing that a bit of debugging the supplied code and doing some planning could resolve though. The projects were also directly correlated (in a simplified version) with concepts that were applicable to my actual work, or things that I was interested in working on which was cool. TAs and students were helpful and there are a lot of office hours and resources for those who are struggling.\nSome gripes I do have though, is the lecture videos are a bit dated (11ish years at the time of me taking the class to be exact). The videos, as well as the projects, are a bit sparse in a way. They never dove as deep as I wish they would. Projects could easily be completed by using the code from the lectures they provided and modifying it in a way that fit a slightly more complex structure. This often got me to around ~95% where tuning some variables would get the extra 5%, but often at the cost of boring hours of changing then testing. To me, that time was not usually worth it unless I had a good idea of what needed to be tuned. I likely could have reduced my average hours by 1 or 2 if I decided not to tune at all and leave my scores in the mid 90s. Lastly, the tests are not difficult, but it did seem up to luck on whether you would have enough time. Additionally, there is no good study materials for the exams. The "study quiz" is filled with pretty rudimentary questions where few calculations are needed (giving a false sense of what might be on the test), but on the test the questions are more difficult requiring more detailed knowledge of the equations and steps used. You are given 2 chances on the tests though, so you have more time to study if you planned accordingly. Additionally, there is extra credit, but the amount of extra credit (2%) seems so low for the level of effort they seemed to require.\nOverall, I found the course interesting. Even though the subjects taught are basic versions of the algorithms used more often in industry it gives you good building blocks. I do wish it was a bit more in-depth touching on derivations and the more advanced versions of concepts learned, but overall I learned a tremendous amount that I have already been able to apply and was not too stressed doing it. I would say if you do not have interest in things like Kalman-Filters or SLAM and their applications then this is a pass.',

Spent 1 day learning the theory, 1 day implementing.\nParticle Filter: 1.5 days total learning and implementing. Excellent, fairly easy grading.\nPID: Conceptually easy but the difficulty is the twiddle algorithm for tuning. It takes some insight too.

However, there were a ton of weird edge cases in the tests I and many folks didn't complete.

Nearly perfect on 1st try.\nFinals: 1 hour, 30 questions, comprehensive. 1 day preparation. Approx. 90% on 1st try, was sufficient for solid A overall.\nOverall:\n\nA good overview of many state estimation, control, search algorithms. Nice to know how easy it is to implement these.\nCovers a few good concepts. However, the actually effort of the course can be cut 50% by not having us pour over edge cases. Although this is part of an actual control engineer's job, it feels wasteful to learn in class. On the other hand, these help improve retention of the algorithms.\nGreat exams that test intuition well.\n",

            review: "RAIT was a great class with a lot of focused learning and good projects, and it was run in a way that felt fair, straightforward, and without any artificial difficulty. The subject matter is mainly ways of localizing and moving robots in a noisy and uncertain physical environment. Search/planning is also covered.\nThis is my second class at OMS after ML4T, and I thought RAIT was both more challenging, and much less hassle by comparison. I completed some of the RAIT projects in less time than it took to read the assignment specifications in ML4T, and even with the accelerated summer schedule it felt like less of a time commitment.\nRAIT's assignment specs were short and to the point, and I never had a hard time figuring out what to do. There was less tuning of hyperparameters than I expected, though the PID project had a lot of that. I didn't really mind because it's a useful skill for anything related to AI/ML.\nAssignments were graded promptly, I was never left wondering what my grade would be on a project or in the class.\nThough not an ML class, RAIT dives into a lot of probability concepts, and if you have no prior background in probability it might be difficult for you. Some linear algebra was used, but it was pretty lightweight compared to what you have to do in an undergrad level linear algebra class like Georgia Tech's MATH 1554. Calculus is not required, though the concept of the integral and derivative do come up briefly, and it's nice if you understand what those are.\nYou should be comfortable with programming in python, or at least another high level language before taking the class.\nI didn't really have a huge interest in robotics prior to taking RAIT, but it definitely got me wanting to explore the subject more deeply. I didn't have time to do the hardware challenge during the class, but I definitely want to give it a shot in my spare time. Overall great class, and doable over the summer semester.",

            review: "I thought this class was a perfect summer class.\nI'll try to add some stuff that is not present in existing course reviews:\n\nPeople say that a lot of time is spent on tuning...I think that is only partially true. If you understand what you are doing, usually the tuning is minimum. There are also some projects (like the particle filter) where I found it next to impossible to pass all of the test cases with a single tuning. However, in cases like this, your test cases are run multiple times to help with some of the randomness and you only have to get like a pass on 15 / 20 to get a perfect score. Tuning was only a little bit, and keep it simple. The projects have great visual debugging, so you can pretty quickly see what is and isn't working.\nFor the summer term, it really helps to plan ahead by looking at the syllabus. Unlike other summer terms, this course does NOT cut out any projects or materials...so expect to sometimes complete multiple lectures in a single week. In one case, we only had 5 days between project due dates. So if you are like me, and plan to take a little summer vacation through the term, it really pays to look work ahead 1 to 2 weeks.\n\nThings that could improve:\nThe professor's lectures and theory is really is really subpar...so temper your expectations. I enjoyed the theory side from RL and the HPC course, but was kind of disappointed when the professor would present classic algorithms like \"magic\" and also refuse to properly identify them (like dijkstra for path finding).\nHowever, I found that the projects made up for this, and the TAs even supplemented a lot of lectures with good tutorial videos in office hours that included more theory and explanation.\nIn all honestly, the TA material was far better than the office hour content.\nAlso, you won't use ML in any sense in this course...so not really a prep course for the actual ML course.\nOverall, I think this is a solid choice for learning about other aspects of AI from a high level (especially robotic control, localization, and path planning). It had just a hint of control systems from electrical engineering and a hints of dynamic programming/policy finding RL to keep me engaged.",

            review: "My favorite things about CS-7638 (Robotics: AI Techniques):\nAlways Projects: The course has 5 projects (same for summer, winter, and fall). For us, in the summer semester, all of the projects were open within the first two weeks, so you had complete flexibility over your schedule. By front-loading my workload, and finishing a lot of projects early, I was able to squeeze in an uninterrupted 2-week family holiday over the summer.\nGraphical Testing: Each project can be run and tested within a graphical environment. For example, in the meteorites project, you can watch your code actually shoot down the incoming meteorites just like the old Atari game. The graphical project environment is a first in OMSCS (for me) and gets a huge thumbs-up! The gamification and realism makes the learning a lot more rewarding.\nWorked Solutions: In addition to the 5 projects, you get 6 graded mini-projects (called 'problem sets'). The professor will actually walk you through the solutions to these problem sets during the lectures. I've also never encountered this before in OMSCS but think it is fantastic!\nUnlimited Attempts: You can submit your projects and problem sets an unlimited number of times to Gradescope. The test cases are not trying to trick you, but they set the bar high and can be challenging. The feedback isn't always as helpful as you would like, but you get enough feedback to work on the right things.\nDouble-Try Exams: You get two attempts for the midterm and the final (another OMSCS first for me). The multiple-choice exam questions exactly match the lecture content. But they are significantly more challenging than the lecture quiz questions as they probe you for genuine insight into the material. They also strive to be fair, with ambiguous questions regularly pulled out of the actual exams and instead moved to the practice exam. Unfortunately, the exam windows are not flexible - so you have to be a bit careful if you want to squeeze in that holiday.\nReal Hardware: The (additional) extra-credit project gives you the option to work with real hardware (which you have to buy yourself). You are encouraged to give any class concept an extra boost by getting it running on the hardware. A lot of students initially took up the challenge, but getting real hardware to behave is really challenging and most students dropped out of this project before the end. Part of this was due to the pathetic 2% bonus score you get upon completion. A bonus score that matched the value of the other projects or the midterm would be a lot more compelling and fair.\nEarly Lectures: The lectures are all available to watch on Udacity before the class even begins. Unfortunately, the Udacity lectures use Python 2 examples, whereas the refreshed lectures have been cleverly updated to Python 3. But the lecture content is exactly the same.\nDedicated Professor: The original professor, Sebastian Thrun, no longer teaches this course. But he has been replaced with a super-knowledgeable instructor, Jay Summet. Many OMSCS courses get orphaned after the professors leave by allowing the TA team to carry on by themselves. This always seems to work surprisingly well, but it is really great to see that OMSCS has hired an actual professor to take over this course. The extra leadership the professor provides seems to keep the material on the cutting edge.\nAmazing TA Team: Not a first for this class as every TA team I've encountered has been amazing. These guys work hard, host a comprehensive set of tutorials, and bring industry knowledge. Thanks for all the help!",

I was astonished at finding how stressful I was during the exams. Students were given 40 minutes for were required to do computation for multiple problems, did not have enough time. I did not do well in exams after having spent the whole week preparing the exam..\nFor every projects, I had to spend 70 hours or more. Specifically, for KF, I spent over 120 hours, still did not pass all test cases. For PF, I spent 100 hours, still had problems with two test cases. PID was easier, I only had to spend 50 hours...\nTHINK IT CAREFULLY FOR TAKING THIS COURSE.\nIT IS DIFFICULT, AND YOU ARE TO WELCOME A LOT OF ASTONISHMENTS (NOT SURPRISES!!!!!)',

I spent over 60 hours a week (no exaggeration!) and for some days I ended up in finishing projects up till 4 am!!! I was struggling with a lot of math and also some signal processing issues, e.g., kf filters, etc.\n\nI noticed some people commented this as "easy" and only need one afternoon per week - that surprised me a lot! Probably they were math students or already had relevant working experience.\n\nMath- heavy course. To do well in this course, you need to have math knowledge, e.g., Linear Algebra, probabilities, etc. If a student reviewed this course as easy, he most likely has a math background.\n\nThe contents are interesting, but difficult. If you are able to spend a significant of time, you may be a good fit for this course. If you have strong math background, you may do well in this course.\nDo not take this course if you cannot make time commitment, particularly in summer (or you are going to have a very stressful summer).',

            review: 'There are already plenty of reviews from the previous semesters, but my experience from Spring 2023 seems a bit different.\nI am a junior programmer and this is my first OMSCS course. I paired it with CS 7210 Distributed Computing. The latter took away almost all my free time, so I could only invest one afternoon in CS 7638 per week, but that was enough: I got 101.5% in this course.\nI aced every project within one afternoon with little parameter tuning, if any. If you need to tune the parameters, as other reviews claim, it is more likely that there is something wrong with your implementation/design, and starting all over again may be more efficient than tuning parameters. If you do get into troubles, just give a few points up and enjoy your life, as the grading of this course is really generous. I just experimented with the median scores on canvas, and it turned out that if you manage to reach the median score in every assignment, you can get a high A. The 2 extra points from research/hardware projects are also easy to get if you follow the instructions. So no worries about tedious work in the projects as it is not that necessary (at least in Spring 2023). If this is your first ever course in computer science, however, make sure to start the projects earlier. You get access to all the projects from the first month, so there is a lot of time for trials and errors, asking and learning. If you need even more time, this course is freely available on Udacity, so you can have a try before formal registration. Keep confident. Trust me, confidence is very important in debugging, just like in sports.\nExams are collections of autograded multiple-choice questions. You are given two attempts on both the midterm and the final! Time is more than enough and the wording are unambiguous. I did not prepare for the exams. They are very easy if you make sure you understand the lectures.\nAs pointed out by other reviews, the lectures lacks mathematics and theory, so it is more suitable as an undergraduate course than a graduate course. However, if you have taken a lot of math and CS courses, you will know that only the best of the best educators can teach you intuitions and ideas in such a clear, direct, and friendly way. If you learn robotics from other instructors, I can guarantee that the same topics will cost you much more time, and you may not be able to achieve the same level of comprehension without years of experience in this field. I learned a lot about how to teach efficiently from Thrun.\nThis course easily becomes my favorite of all time. Good luck, keep confident, and enjoy it.',

            review: "This class is a perfect introduction into grad school. It's a great medium difficulty class for me on topics that are extremely relevant to my professional field (Spacecraft GN&C Software). Kalman Filters, Particle Filters, and SLAM are things I've wanted to dig into a bit more for awhile now, and this class was able to give me that practical experience with those topics.\nThat being said, I do wish this class dove deeper into these topics. It's a bit too easy for my liking, I would have preferred to have been forced to use an extended kalman filter at some point, as those are typically what's used in practice. There's little derivation of the math either, so my understanding of it is shakier than I would like. That's fine for most people who wont actually use this and just want to get the general idea, but since I plan on building on this knowledge I was left wanting a bit more.\nIf there were follow on classes for some of these topics in the program, I'd say this would be a 5/5 introduction into the topics. However, since this is the only source of context for many of these topics, it's just not deep enough to actually say I have a solid foundation in sensor fusion and localization. It's a foundation, but a shallower one than I would expect for a graduate class. It seems if I want to continue on these topics I have to do research or switch degrees :/\nI will say though, generally this class is run very well. No real busy work/frustration with requirements. Projects clearly let you test out your understanding of the material, even though its on the shallower side. I saw others complaining about the TAs and I really can not understand how they could possibly have that opinion. The TAs go out of their way to create hours of tutorial video content to support the lectures, they curate resources that help for the projects, they actively respond to threads with questions about the projects and lectures. Very high quality TAs in my opinion for a very well run class.",

The actually content of the course is not too difficult (everything is relative) but the lack of support from staff and TA’s was very disappointing to say the least. When the large majority of your grade is based on 5 projects and said projects are all auto-graded, the least you should expect is TA’s to help with code reviews. But instead, code reviews are ignored for days until you receive a minimal effort response where you are not sure if the staff even read your code. I guess you get what you pay for with online degrees. Very disappointed after high expeditions for OMSCS.',

            review: "This was my 7th course in the program. 1st AI course. I read the reviews here before taking the class. TBH, I was quite hesitant taking it because of the reviews exaggerating the tuning portion of some projects.\nWell, that turned out to be not the case..\nTL;DR: If you know what you're doing, you don't have to tune endlessly.\nSure, on the subject of tuning, there are moments of \"please kill me now\" but I found it stems from misunderstanding the conceptual basis of the projects. In one project, I didn't even have to tune much while Ed threads were full of tuning discussions. I suspected my own implementation in certain cases with respect to tuning.\nProjects took me longer than I intended because I tend to start before I exhaust all the related modules first. You need to understand the course material fully before starting on your design and code. A well configured workspace would help a lot, so get your workspace sorted out as soon as possible.\nAll TAs are awesome, but Chris' tutorials are such gems.. They are better than lecture videos at some points. I honestly think those tutorials can easily be the part of primary course material as opposed to being supplementary tutorials. I was able to finish at least 2 projects thanks to Chris' tutorials.\nOne more important note: TIME MANAGEMENT!\nI had to trade percentages of my project scores with time. That's where the \"endless tuning argument\" comes from, I think. If you're obsessed with getting 100% for everything, true, tuning can hurt your time management. I gave up at my best scores to move forward, which was about 97% at the lowest. So.. Time management is important.\nI managed to land a low A. I wasn't particularly good at midterm and final. I almost aced all other assignments. In that sense, it's a forgiving course for those who are not perfect test takers.\nFinal note:\nPrepare an excel sheet to compute your overall final grade. Head TA is managing what's shown in Canvas in a weird way. Final wasn't part of the assignments until almost finals week. I learned it hard way not to rely on Canvas grades in the past. Due to missing entry in graded content, Canvas was showing a different overall score and letter grade than my excel sheet. If you end up calculating your safest midterm/final grades, Canvas might not be reliable to do \"what if\" analysis for how many points you need per graded item.",

This is my first OMSCS course.\nThe course is an easy A, but with enough extra difficulty to be worth taking. You can get a 90 with minimal effort, but IMO it's worth it to push yourself a little to get a 95-100 and squeeze out more learning and fulfillment from the course.\nThe projects are well-designed so that you can get a high grade (80+) by doing the bare minimum, but that you have to exert a bit more effort to get a perfect score. Same banana with the midterms and finals.\nThe TAs are excellent, and are easy to reach through Ed. The tutorials are also fantastic; sometimes I learned more through the tutorials than I did the lectures. The one downside is that the lectures by Dr. Thrun are too simple and outdated. I would have liked more mathematical rigor, or technical detail. The lectures are almost 10 years old and are due for an update.\nI recommend this class for people who need a high grade, or are looking for an easy 2nd course. You can also take it as your first OMSCS course if you want to ease into the program.",

Most of the lessons are good, each of the projects are carefully crafted, the TAs are pretty responsive, and the midterm and final feel very fair.\nThe one thing I found a little bit annoying is the way that the class' assignments get updated over time. The Warehouse project seemingly had a new step added this semester, which was graded way more harshly than the other sections (one student even went into a huge back and forth with the TA over this on Ed for days) and way more difficult to debug. I feel like it could have been more carefully tested before being released. But with that said, it wasn't terrible or anything, and the projects on the whole are definitely a net positive.\nThe extra credit assignments are also very cool, they encourage you to go above and beyond in a way that won't take up a ridiculous amount of your time.\nOverall would recommend, although note that this class isn't very difficult; I'm sure that's a plus for some, but if you're an experienced developer looking to really push yourself, you'd be better off just watching the lectures and tackling some harder problems from somewhere out there.",

I did a Hon. BSc Mathematics about a decade ago. I started programming 2020 so I don't have a ton of experience. I had learned a little bit of Javascript and Swift since 2020 but no Python up until this course.\nPros:\n\nI felt that the content of the course was both interesting and likely useful in the future for myself. Although the usefulness might differ from person to person.\nI enjoyed the lecture videos which were well explained and concise. Prof. Thrun did a good job motivating what we were learning with his own work.\n-The Ed Discussion forums were extremely fruitful. The TA's and students who post do a great job supporting each other during projects.\n-I learned a decent amount of Python.\n-I liked that there are gaps in the workload i.e. some weeks I didn't do anything for the course.\n\nCons:\n-The content is a little shallow at points. I would have personally liked a  little bit more mathematical rigour.\n-Tuning during projects can be annoying but probably a necessary evil.\n-I've been looking at jobs in robotics and they're almost universally looking for C++ experience, which makes sense. I wish this course or a follow-on course exposed us to C++.\nOverall it was a great crash course into Python for me and confirmed that I would like to pursue CP&R. I'll end up with a high A, which I am happy with and judging from grade statistics, the median grade for the class is also an A.\nI spent a lot of time on this course (although I didn't track the hours). If I was a better programmer I probably could have cut the time on the projects by 90%. The vast majority of the time I spent was on debugging. But ultimately all that debugging forced me to review the code constantly so I feel like I have a strong understanding of the content. The projects were enjoyable, although my computer always crashed when I tried to run the visualizations that people seem to enjoy.\nIf you have a decent grasp of statistics the course should be a breeze.\n10/10 would take.",

            review: 'I took this course during my first semester in the program and enjoyed it. It’s a good starter class for people getting going.\nSome disclaimers though –\nIf you don’t have any linear algebra background, you may have a bad time. I hadn’t taken a math course in ~10 years and the math beat me up at times. Sometimes formulas would be presented without explanation, and if you don’t understand the “why” by reading them, you may have to spend a lot of time watching outside tutorials to figure out what’s going on.\nTuning is a HUGE part of this course. Let’s say a project takes 30 hours to complete. You might spend 15 hours getting the code to work and then another 15 hours working on 10 lines of code tweaking numbers to get it to work. This is mind numbing and very unfulfilling. I’d suggest watching the Twiddle lecture in week 1 and using this throughout the course to help your tuning efforts.\nGrade-wise it’s an easy A or B. There are problem sets where they walk through the solutions in lecture and allow you to submit that code. So you have a built-in buffer of 20% of your grade where you should have 100%. The exams also allow you to take twice and keep your best grade, which is helpful.\nThe projects are interesting, and are the remaining 65% of your grade. They are autograded, so you can know how you’re doing before you submit. And they all have visualizations, which make them more fun to see your results.\nLastly, watch every single thing Chris records. His office hours / lectures clear so many tricky concepts up. He’ll walk through things in layman terms, which is incredibly helpful. For some lessons, you could skip Dr. Thrun’s videos entirely and get all you need from Chris. Dr. Thrun’s videos are a little tough to get through at times. He’s kind of cheesy, which can get annoying (congratulates you at the end of lessons, says so many things are “INCREDIBLE” and “AMAZING”, which is frustrating if you’re not understanding at that time).\nOverall, this is a good course if you get past how much time tuning takes. It may scare you away from a career in robotics though if that’s what the job is like.',

            review: "This course is great so far.\nContent - The content is good but sometimes the examples used by Dr. Thrun get confusing and leave room for more context and follow-up discussions on Ed Stem and Office hours. Go through the content early to have a detailed discussion with fellow students and TAs later.\nStaff - All of the teaching staff are very helpful. As always, the engagement from the staff is dependent upon how well you frame your question and how much information you can supply in a structured format for them to process. But regardless, they do their best.\nWorkload - The workload is decent. Weeks with the problem sets due are easier than the weeks on which the projects are due. Of course, one can always plan better and make the schedule more balanced for themselves.\nMy 2 cents - Do the lectures and the problem sets early to leave more room for actual projects. There is a lot of parameter tuning required which is not the best use of your learning time so split it across several days. Don't let the frustration of the tuning take away the benefits of understanding how these approximation algorithms work.\nTinker with stuff, ask questions on why stuff works the way it does and focus on mathematics and explanations behind concepts.\nPre-reqs - Learn python, NumPy functions and have a refresher on linear algebra (matrix multiplication, etc.).",

The materials can be overwhelming for non-AI background people like me, but it is possible to deliver fine-enough results. It doesn't require a ridiculous amount of efforts, but definitely needs some focus and brain-scratching.\nTowards  the end, the course feels lighter since the materials end early and you only need to focus on the projects. I spent way less time on Warehouse and SLAM compared to Particle and Drone for some reasons. The % of exams are quite low, so if all projects has >= 90% there is not much pressure on them. I did not go all in on projects (frankly I think it is too hard for me to get the perfect scores), but 10~12 hours/week is enough to scrape an A. I did learn a lot and have a good (and hopefully representative) overview on AI.",

Personally I don\'t mind math equations and I feel it necessary for graduate level courses. With the current setup, you kind of have to translate the "layman terms" in the class to "academic terms" first, and then search for more serious stuff accordingly. But don\'t worry, the teaching staff in this class are always willing to help. So, I would say this is an improvement suggestion rather than a "con".',

            review: "This is my second semester and I took AI at the same time. The first assignment search of AI defnitely saves me a lot of time for Warehouse and SLAM projects. All assigments are really fun and come with visualization. Some projects are heavily relied on parameters tuning (Kalman filter, particle filter, PID control), which take me a lot of time resubmitting them on Gradescope but the resubmission process also reinforces my understanding in the hyperparameters. So I want to complain about the heavy parameters tuning but I also like it LOL. The lecture videos are kind of outdated but the TAs make fabulous tutorials to fill the gap between lecture videos and assignments. I got 98 for this course by only watching the lecture videos, tutroals, recommended materials in assignemnt instruction, ED discussions, and slack channels. I didn't spent any time reading the textbook or other online materials. All TAs and instructors are wonderful! They are super responsive in answering ED threads. All my ED questions got answered by someone within a day. Midterm and Final have 15 and 30 questions, respectively. They offered a small practice exam pool and most questions come from, or at least similar to the quizzes in lecture videos. I got 85% for both exams without preparation. I think they are trying to make this course more difficult than beofore, but I enjoyed it.",

            review: "PERSONAL BACKGROUND\n\nI'm a first semester co-enrolled in CS 6601: Artificial Intelligence.\nOfficially speaking, I do not have a CS background, but I did complete 2-3 years of CS undergraduate courses in order to prepare for this program, which was definitely worthwhile.\n\nPROS\n\nYou will learn important concepts and algorithms used in robotics to help robots deal with uncertainty as they try to achieve various goals.\nThe content is interesting and provides you with many insights into robotics that are not obvious.\nIn my opinion, the programming assignments strike the right balance between difficulty level and still being doable.\nTAs and instructor are very helpful and responsive.\n\nCONS\n\nThis course lacks a proper introduction to the basic concepts of robotics, and this is a major problem. For instance, module 1 begins discussing localization (how a robot determines it's own location in a map) without ever defining what robot is or how a robot even works. Having a mental model of such things before diving into topics like localization or motion planning would be really helpful. In the beginning of the course, I had to turn to outside resources and scramble to develop a conceptual framework I could build on.\nThe course textbook/lectures lack proofs and mathematical rigor. Terms are often ill defined. Erroneous and unconventional notation abound. The textbook in particular would strongly benefity from an editor who is a mathmatican combing through it.\nCertain topics are explained with painfully insufficient depth and clarity. In particular I'm thinking of the lectures regarding A* search and dynamic programming with/without stochastic action. The latter even contains fundamental theoretical errors that only became apparent after I turned to outside resources to recieve a proper education.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nI do believe the course delivers on the promise of introducing you to key ideas and algorithms in probabilistic robotics. Do not expect to be some expert; it is a shallow but wide exploration of important tasks performed by robots, namely self-driving cars, and how such tasks are implemented in terms of software.\nOn average i spent about 20 hours/week on the material: reading, proofs, lectures, coding, turning to outside resources to fill in gaps.\nThe content itself is not challenging to grasp. It is only made difficult by the lack of background that is provided at times: it's either assumed you already know enough about the given topic to keep up, or the foundation for the topic is poorly introduced. A good example would be parameter tuning in coding assignments. Many students complain about the tedious, excessive, and arbitrary nature of it. This is only because the course assumes, or doesn't care to explain, a knowledge of appropriate search or optimaization algorithms.\n\nPREPARATION TIPS\n\nI do not recommend this as a first semester course. Instead, I strongly urge any first timer to take CS 6601: Artificial Intelligence. It is a proper intro to the AI/ML field and all relevant concepts in this robotics class. Anyone taking this class would be served by reading the following chapters in Artifical Intelligence: A Modern Approach, 4th Edition, Norvig\nCh 2 Intelligent Agents\nCh 3 Solving Complex Problems by Searching (particularly Informed Search Algorithms such as A*)\nCh 4 Search in Complex Environments\n",

You have to put tons of time but you will gain almost nothing from the projects. It is not because it is hard to understand, but because it is just tuning a hyper-parameter which does not require any knowledge or understanding of subject. You can get an easy A if you are ready to put random numbers with tons of time without thinking.\nWhen you ask something that is very simple, the TAs are very responsible.

            review: "This was my first class into OMSCS. I had read that a lot of people really thought it was a good starter class and I thought the topic seemed interesting enough. CS, matrices, self driving cars? What’s not to love? I ended up being very wrong. The biggest flaw with this class are the people “teaching” it. The professor uses content that is 10+ years old taught by a completely different person. The professor honestly spends office hours answering Piazza questions with no visual diagrams whatsoever and is pretty hands off otherwise. I would love to have a teaching gig where I didn’t write the content and I let my TAs do all the work. Speaking of TAs, while they are more helpful than the professor, they are also useless. In making a private post to the TAs about some trouble I was having I was simply told to “google it” and “think about your problem some more and you’ll find the answer”, super helpful. The real MVPs are the other students making the Piazza post. They will answer questions and even help you with some of your errors.\nThe weekly work hours are hard to pin down as some weeks you have next to nothing to do and other weeks you will have a project due which could take you several hours to complete. The homework for this class wasn't terrible, they gave the answers although they are Python 2 and your answer should be in Python 3, so that was fun to try and translate those. The professor and TAs do expect you to work 3 weeks ahead though. They will have office hours for a project that is due in three weeks and then will not answer any more questions after that.\nThe projects for this class are the biggest point values for the class. The first few projects are not too bad, but the last two projects will for sure set apart the As from the Bs. I had an A in the class until I got to the last two projects. The difficulty for these projects is insane compared to the ones from earlier in the semester. Both projects have second parts that are weighted more heavily than in earlier projects, these extensions are not taught in the class and are more application based, that being said, in the beginning they are worth 20% of your grade, at the end they are worth 60%. Totally unfair in my opinion.\nThe midterm was really easy. All multiple choice. It’s only 5% of your grade though. The final exam however (worth 10%), was advertised as being “just like” the midterm, but the questions on it were not just multiple choice. They were multiple select, fill in the blank, etc… Thus increasing the difficulty needlessly.\nTLDR - Don’t take this. Getting a B in this class feels like A work. I am lucky that I had such a high grade going into the later part of the semester, but if you are barely at a B by mid semester, you might want to consider dropping. Professor and TAs are getting paid to do next to nothing and overall the class needs a complete rework as the content is practically old enough to vote.",

There's a refresher for this class in the beginning. Sometimes the projects are fairly straightforward such as the drone tuning project and the first project with Kalman filters, but there's a lot more time involved in getting it just right. The ones that are more difficult for sure are the warehouse project and the SLAM project, which I was not able to get 100% on, only 85 and 84. I bombed the first midterm on both tries, but I luckily got 100% on all the other projects and studied my butt off for two days to get a B on the final (cumulative), which got me a solid A in the class. If you read the reviews here, they're mostly from biased people who got an A that I guess brag about their intelligence? Well, I got my A through hard work between this and another class, and I definitely learned a lot, although the material was outdated. It was still super interesting as a first exposure to robotics and reading the lesson notes were a lifesaver instead of watching the lectures when it came to reviewing for the final (minus the bicycle motion lectures, you need to still watch those). At times I'd neglect this class and spend time on the other one, but it was almost like they were neck and neck in needing my attention at times. Do not start projects late. You can procrastinate on learning but do not start projects late, that will save you heartache, especially for when you find they end up taking a while to pass the test cases and the test cases in grade scope are NOT the same as they are locally. The homework was more of a \"did I watch the lectures\" kind of deal. They essentially give you the answers for most of it, there are some updates you'd need to make to your answers due to errata/python language being updated. Safe to say I enjoyed this class and am considering switching from Machine Learning SP to Robotics! If you like using your brain to do trigonometry, linear algebra, small amounts of calculus, programming, physics, this course has a decent combo of it all. If you're from not from an engineering/STEM background, you will likely need to brush up. I had to debug several things by hand. There's also plenty of office hours support, which sometimes I had to resort to and was very helpful actually.\nProfessor and TAs are smart as whips and really good quality. Piazza though? Please move to Ed Discussion like other courses. You will spend a lot of time reading discussions on Piazza searching for clues, ideas, insights sometimes when you hit a roadblock.\nGetting a B in this class is not hard to obtain. You can probably do minimal work. Getting an A is where it gets rough.",

You see a lot of reviews for other classes where the teaching staff are not active, projects don't work, etc.  You will not have that problem in this class.\nThe class is very asynchronous, so you can work ahead and then take time off.  There are whole weeks I did nothing at all and single weekends where I spent >25 hours working on a project.  Projects require 30-50 hrs each if you want to get 100%.  Just getting by with 80% will require half that much time.  There are not too many projects though and they are fun.\nI will reiterate what others have said, because I think it is the reason people do well in this class or not and whether they like it or not.  That is, you will not get all of the information you need from Sebastian Thrun's pre-recorded lectures.  However, you will get the answers you need if you read the supplemental materials, take the initiative to ask questions on Piazza, and spend time really trying to understand the material.  You have to be willing to very clearly post on Piazza what it is you are not understanding.  If the TA's can see that you put in the time and effort to try to understand the concept before posting your question, they will give you the information you need.  If you don't show in your post that you put any effort into understanding the concept first, you won't get as much help (or sometimes any).  You will learn a lot in this class, but you won't do it in 5-10 hours per week like many people mention spending.  Just watching the lectures isn't enough.",

I feel that their participation in the discussion board was a huge boon to my learning. They are a large part of why I gave this class a 5/5.\nIn terms of workload, it fluctuates significantly.

Average is probably 10 or less a week.\nMy background is in Mechanical Engineering, relatively little programming experience although I am probably most proficient in Python, which was helpful. Nothing in this class was too difficult for me and I was only a slightly above average student in undergraduate. Just put in the effort and you should easily get above 90% for an A. 80% for a B would probably only take 5 hours a week, if that - though you probably wouldn't learn much.",

So this course, in summary, really really really hard for me.\nEvery project took me more than 40 hours, and they are filled with tiny details that I don't know before (and I have no idea where to learn those unless read all piazza posts). Professor or TA will give hints about reading certain parts of lecture or assignment, which technically provides 70% of the code needed for project. The other 30% took me a lot of time to understand and implement.\nLectures can use some update. Although I appreciate the effort of TA and professor doing weekly office hour, I honestly didn't benefit much from those. Still getting most out of piazza posts. My classmates are kind smart people that willing to post on piazza and answer questions, I learned a lot from them.\nSalute to those people saying this course is easy, maybe there are genius I am just not one of them.",

It could be very frustrating at times because your code could be 99% correct but you could be getting a grade of 0% due to the autograder\nExams were hard to prepare for and the practice questions made them seem like they were much easier then they actually are\nLectures were decent but could definitely do with a re-write (especially the SLAM portion). They are like almost 10 years old but still have errata in them and the lecturer really likes to congratulate you on grasping basic concepts which lulls you into a false sense of security.",

            review: "I'm going to preface my review with this: I entered this class thinking I would be interested in the material. Turns out, I was not. So you may want to take my review with a grain of salt :)\nI was not a fan of this class. As other reviewers have pointed out, it really doesn't feel like a graduate level class, especially at a top-10 graduate program. The projects are mostly easy, I'd describe them (and the class in general) as \"very easy B, easy-ish A\". They added a midterm for fall 21, but it's only 5% of the grade (final is  only 10%), meaning you can no longer just ace the projects and get an A. That being said, midterm was not that hard, and if the final is the same, I'll expect an A. Plus, you can do the math on percentages here: if you ace the projects (some of which have bonus opportunities), you can skip the midterm and still only need a 50% on the final for an A.\nThe lectures were not that great. They did a good job giving an overview of how self-driving cars work, did go into some details... then that's it. Maybe it was the fact that halfway through the class I realized that robotics/AI is not for me, but honestly the lectures just seemed boring.\nAt the end of the day, this is still an easy class if you want a lighter workload. Getting a B is absurdly easy, and A still easy, but will require you to do some work. I took this class along with another during the semester and usually only spent <5 hours a week on this class, with more (10-15) when projects were due.\nTL;DR: If you're interested in how robots find where they are in a world and determine how to move, you'll like it. If you only want an easier workload, take it. If not, I'd say stay away.",

            review: "I took this course to get a gentle introduction to the field of robotics, but I have to say I'm very, very disappointed. This course uses outdated lectures filmed back in 2012 and hasn't been updated since. The code provided in the lecture has absolutely atrocious style where I could barely understand anything it was trying to do. I got lucky at the end barely scratch a 90 to obtain an A. But I really didn't feel like I learnt anything from the course and would probably never use the material ever again.\nHere's a quick breakdown of the projects with my time commitment/opinions:\nKalman Filter (15 hrs) - The filter itself was not very hard. The second part of the project involves shooting the laser and clear out the localized objects. A simple algorithm like sweeping actually worked for me, I was able to get 100 on this project\nParticle Filter (30 hrs +) -  Wasted almost the entire week on this project. There was an overview video that covered something that was not covered in lectures, that kind of helped a bit. I was able to get it working eventually after tuning over almost a million different parameters.  101/100\nA* Search/Dynamic Programming (20 hrs) - This was probably the only kind of useful project for me as I learned something about A* search and implement one on my own. The code provided in the lecture for this topic start to get ridiculously ugly. Online sources are more helpful. 100/100\nPID Controller (<10 hrs) - This one is just tuning parameters and is kind of boring, but it's not hard. 100/100.\nSLAM (??? hrs, I didn't finish) -this project was the one that told me this whole robotics thing just isn't for me. I could barely understand anything the sample code in the lecture was doing, I felt like there has to be a different way that the matrix is constructed that is less confusing. I got part A to pass that was it. Ending up being really, really frustrated with the project and got a 56/100\nAt this point of the semester, I pretty much lost all my motivation and just want the course to be over. I didn't review anything on the material and just took the final exam. They did give you 2 attempts and take the higher one. I got 22/30 and luckily scratch an A.\nSo, honest opinion. This course ISN'T the best course in OMSCS unless you are extremely interested in the subject. I kind of regret taking such a course and drawn myself in endless stress and frustration",

            review: "My background: Software Engineer using C/Python. Mechanical Engineering background.\nRelatively easy course. Problem set solutions are given to you, video lectures are nice and easy to follow, and you'll get a lot of help on the projects from other students and TA's. The projects are by far the most interesting part of the class, and they are actually really fun to complete. Here's a quick breakdown of the projects with my time commitment/opinions:\nKalman Filter (10 hrs) - the filter is easy to build since the video lectures tell you exactly what to do. The harder part was the second section which for summer involved building an algorithm to target objects after localizing them. It honestly felt like the majority of my effort was not even working on the filter, and the lectures only go very surface level on this. Great intro to the topic though. 100/100 final grade.\nParticle Filter (15 hrs) - this one was tough. There are SO many things to tune with a particle filter and not every component of it is covered in the lectures (such as fuzzing, they added a supplementary video that I didn't see at first). It was such an incredibly cool project, but very frustrating since the tuning took forever, but I guess that's the point they wanted to convey. 101/100 final grade.\nA* Search/Dynamic Programming (10 hrs) - cute animations of a warehouse robot. The algorithms are cool and there's actually a lot of design that you have to figure out yourself, but you can use the lectures and problem sets to help you along. Very fun! 101/100 final grade.\nPID Controller (<10 hrs) - this one isn't as fun, although the PID controller is a very important concept to learn. Definitely the easiest of all the projects. 100/100 final grade.\nSLAM (10-12 hrs) - pretty easy to grasp if you have some background in linear algebra. The project itself was fun but very tough to tune/design to pass every single test case consistently. It was also the last one so maybe I just lost motivation. 93/100 final grade.\nFinal exam was fair. I'd recommend writing down notes of basic concepts of all the algorithms you learn during the semester. Most of the questions will quiz your knowledge of these. 25/30 final grade.\nI ended up with a 98% in the class, with probably half the weeks spending 0 time since I was able to get ahead pretty easily. Not saying this to brag, but to let you know this is an easier class (if you have some coding/math background) that doesn't really go too into depth. For me, it was a great class for the summer and a good intro to these algorithms I've never used before. Would recommend.",

The lectures are easy to follow and Piazza is active and TAs were helpful. The projects are pretty interesting and well documented. The class lectures are often not enough to finish the projects though. You'll need to delve deeper into the topics, and participate in office hours. The projects were released well ahead of time, which was very helpful. The book was recommended, but I personally did not read it! Optional links for youtube tutorials and other reading materials were helpful. The final in this semester was 11% of the total grdaes (expect this to increase in upcoming semesters). It was possible still to not take the final and get an A using extra credit hardware/research challenge. The final would be a closed everything exam and requires a room scan.

I have no background in Robotics/AI - and have lost my memory about physics, matrix and linear algebra.\nFor old farts like myself, I don't think this course is a cake walk. It made me think through. At the same time it is not that hard, in a sense that if you put in some work - you will definitely get some good results. It's just that the initial uncertainty of each project is high, and there is an initial 'steep' catch up that you need to do from Sebastian Thrun's lectures and map it to the project requirement. The curve then falls sharply off and becomes easy. It does make you work to get those additional 10 - 15 points and you need to apply some ingenuity, out of the box thinking to get those.\nI would say Sebastian's lectures were not that great. The guy just keeps congratulating you and makes you feel contented until you eventually have toilet crying sessions trying to figure out why the a project needed me to implement what Sebastian mentioned was not worth 'memorizing' (for example). Eventually I realized this is the difference in quality between what an 'Udacity' module is V/S what a real GA tech course looks like.\nI think Jay and Chris nailed it and made the class an absolute fun with the projects. I feel they should just create a brand new recording of lectures and scrap off Sebastian's.",

            review: "I have a somewhat unique view on this course because I started it a few years ago but had to withdraw early due to work pressure, then retook the course Summer 2021. As a result I've seen two iterations of it, which provides some context for recent and earlier reviews.\nWhen I tried the course a few years ago I'd say it was \"medium\". The lectures were OK but it was widely known that you could bypass the course material and just brute-force some basic geometry at a lot of the projects, which took a lot of the fun out of the experience. By comparison, the 2021 version has been revised, with new projects that have a much closer correspondence to the lecture material. By OMSCS standards the projects are also top-notch - the instructions are clear, the classes that you interface with are well built, and you are provided with visual debugging tools that really help to build intuition for robot navigation. There is a bit of inconsistency between the lecture content and the projects (this is similar in a lot of OMSCS courses ... it will be interesting to see whether the program can adapt as its prerecording MOOCs age) but the TAs provide some nice videos to help bridge the gaps.\nBeyond the above, the TAing for this course was absolutely top-notch. After working through a pretty student-hostile experience in RL last semester, this was a huge positive change. Jay and his team obviously care deeply about the student experience, and it really shows through in the effort that they put into the office hours, Piazza posts, assignments, and other materials.\nOverall I'd say this is a great little summer course, and not too much work, assuming you have a decent background in Linear Algebra, Python, and Probability. If you don't have that background then you may want to take it in Spring or Fall, as I'd imagine that some of the projects could get pretty frustrating quickly.",

Just be aware, unless you are an expert in robotics, this class is hard work, not an easy A as other say and according to the comments, it is getting harder each semester. This summer, projects were changed, and new and more difficult sections were added.

Even a shorter sem of Robotics isn't a match to CP in terms of effort. That being, its a perfect summer sem course that has enough to keep a student busy for the majority of 11 weeks.\nYou have to finish 6 problems sets and 5 projects in those 11 weeks. You get answers to 6 problem sets before they are due. But if one chooses to solve them on their own, which I did, these keep you busy and are rewarding. I bet, if Instructor doesn't release these answers before these are due, the class avg difficulty rating shall go up a fair bit.\nMy favorite projs are MarsGLider, Warehouse and GemStones(frustrating at times).\nDownside: I didn't know how much tuning is needed to get solutions. At times makes it seem like our solution doesn't have solid footing or science. Guess thats the nature of Robotics.\nSome students complain that the course is light and doesn't cover topics in much greater detail. I disagree 100%. What do you expect from a 11 week semester? build a real MarsGlider!?!. It has enough concepts to get you started. There could at best be an advanced RObotics class that picks up from where this class left off. All in all a very well organized class.",

Turns out it had a heavy focus on linear algebra and some statistics. I dislike both of these so this might also be why I didn't enjoy this class. The lectures were pretty useless besides the fact that you could copy over the code as a starting point for each project. The projects felt like a ton of guesswork with constantly tuning variables and I can't honestly say I learned much at all, even when I got 100 on all of the projects besides the final. So if you're looking for a course on programming robots themselves (First Robotics style) and simulations, etc. then this is not the course. If you like math and have an interest in A* search, Dynamic Programming, Kalman filters, etc. then this might be something for you. Taking it in the summer definitely made it a lot more challenging as well.",

            review: "AI4R (or has it been rebranded RAIT?) ended up being a fairly low-stress course that had a few enjoyable and informative bits. If you're really into robotics, you could take this course and work on the (optional) hardware challenges and probably get a lot more out of it. I was only looking for a slightly easier course to fill the summer while I've got some more time-consuming stuff going on at my job. For that, the course was perfect.\nThe meat of the course comes in the 6 projects, all python and build from scaffolding provided by the instructors. None were overly difficult, but neither were they trivial; I thought they were a decent challenge that made you consider the course concepts without making you pull your hair out. Another great thing about them is that they're auto-graded with infinite attempts and immediate feedback, and there's no written report that goes along with them. The instructions and code comments are thorough, and there weren't really any gotchas; these were well-designed projects with good visualizations, too.\nThe lectures felt a bit disconnected from the rest of the course because it was some other guy focusing hard on self-driving cars. He seemed enthusiastic, though, and the lectures weren't mind-numbing or time-wasting. You also finish all of the lectures about 2/3 of the way through the course, leaving a fair amount of downtime where you can focus on the projects, and if you finish those quickly, you have free time. This makes it perfect for a summer course.\nThe last thing I'll mention is that the TAs for my semester were great; very responsive and helpful on Piazza.\nMy ranking for the courses I've taken thus far in terms of overall enjoyability: VGD > KBAI > ML4T = AI4R >>> HCI > SDP >>> ML > IIS",

The answers are given to you, so it's easy to get the credit for completing them, but they essentially go into more detailed topics than the lectures. These topics also show up on the final.\nI didn't find the projects too difficult, every one of them became rather easy to get over 90% after reading enough Piazza and supplemental resources.\nOverall the class was pretty well structured as far as lecture topics and assignment organization, although there were a lot of weeks with not much going on.",

            review: "Quick background:  This was my second class in the program.  I have a BS in CS from 20 years ago.  Have not worked in the industry for 15+ years.  Have taken a few ML certificate courses on Coursera and took KBAI my first semester.\nReview:\nOverall I really liked this class.  I can see why some of the more technical people in the program find this course very easy but for my background, I found it difficult yet rewarding.  Mostly because of the projects and how they really made you dig in to each topic and understand the inner workings involved.  It was very frustrating at times and at a couple points early in the semester I almost dropped the course because I just could not find information to explain the roadblocks I was hitting on implementing the projects.\nMy mistake is I was too hesitant to post questions on Piazza because I felt they were too basic or \"dumb questions\".  I should have just posted them and saved myself a lot of headaches.  I managed to finally find enough resources and wrap my head around the topics.\nThe 12 hours/week is a bit misleading as I finished the course about 6 weeks early, so I averaged about 20 hours/week in the 11 weeks I actually worked on the class.   At times during the coding projects I physically celebrated when something worked (you know the chair dance), which is highly unusual for me.  But that's how nice it felt to work really hard to understand a concept and then have it produce correct results upon implementation.  This is a credit to the project materials and setup as well as to the professor and TAs.\nFor the actual course videos, I found them a bit lacking in depth.  Based on my admittedly weak background, I did a ton of independent study, watching hours of YouTube videos on the subject material because the lessons just did not provide the depth needed to complete the assignments.  Totally fine, and expected for a graduate-level class so this isn't really a complaint but more of a heads up.  The details of how a Kalman Filter works and the inner workings of the SLAM algorithm were two topics that I worked most extensively on outside of class materials.\nThe professor and TAs were very active and very helpful on Piazza as well as weekly office hours over Blue Jeans.  The TAs especially were super-engaging with the students trying to help them out and clarify topics, very fast to respond and thorough.  Students were also very helpful to those of us with less experience/understanding of the topics.\nProjects were fun and I loved that everything is available from the beginning of the semester so you can work at your own pace and get ahead of things if you're anxious about your abilities or if you have life stuff planned throughout the semester.\nThe homework assignments were pretty low stress and the answers are given in the subsequent videos so if you get stuck, you can watch the answer videos to help you get through.  Trying on your own to understand and implement the homework definitely comes in handy for the projects though.\nDeliverables have unlimited Gradescope submissions so you can see what you're going to get for a grade and have a good idea where you stand as the semester progresses.  There is a final exam at the end, it is worth 10% of the total but with the HW and Projects you can go into that final with near 100% and only need to get a few questions correct to get an A in the course.  I did not review the material at all and my exam grade suffered for it, but by that time I had been done with the material for 6 weeks and was not motivated to put a lot of effort into the exam.  Admittedly I shortchanged myself from using the exam to solidify my understanding of the topics, but we all have lives outside of this program and sometimes you have to pick your battles.\nDefinitely recommend this course for those of you who may still be early in the program and want to get your feet wet before diving into the classes that have reputations for being more difficult.",

            review: "A well structured beginner course for anyone interested in building the brain of self driving cars. Content-wise, the course has broadly 3 components - Object Localization, Planning and Control. The lectures were pretty easy to follow. Dr Thrun starts from very basics and beautifully explains the concepts all along. This semester, there were 6 problem sets and 5 projects which comprise of 90% of the grades. All of them were auto graded on gradescope, so there's no ambiguity or long reports to be written. Python is the language adopted in this course.  The 6 problem sets were part of lecture videos and we were allowed to peek into the solutions. The projects had varying difficulty. While many might find them easy, it took me almost 10 hours on average for each of them. A couple of them took 20+ hours. All the projects and problem sets are made available within 2 weeks of course start and so there is ample time to complete them. The projects really stimulate the learning and helped understand the concepts better.The greatest part of the course were the TA's. They were exceptionally helpful and active of piazza. Dr Summet used to actively participate in the office hours and resolve our queries. There were extra credit opportunities in form of research paper reading and hardware problems. There were separate OH to discuss the hardware problems. There was a cumulative end term exam of 10% weightage. We were give 2 attempts and the best of 2 was taken. The course is very student centric and scoring as well.",

            review: "Take this course if you are really into robotics or you want an easy A. Otherwise, don't have any learning expectations. The only good thing I found was the structure of the assignments in the sense that you knew what score you would get thanks to the auto-grader. However, most of the time on the assignments is spent on coding against some really complex formulas which the professor thinks you don't even need to understand (which I agree with) and tweaking some parameters for days to pass the auto-grader. I really got no learning from the assignments or lectures although I got an A.",

            review: "If you're interested in Robotics, this is the best you're going to get from OMSCS. The lectures for this class are 100% taken from old Sebastian Thrun videos that he created many years ago. I love Sebastian, he's amazing, and he's a huge inspiration for me, but if you've taken his Robotics classes via Udacity - like the Self-Driving Car Nanodegrees - there won't be anything new here for you. That said, I did personaly enjoy reviewing the material. THAT said, I am pretty disappointed this is the only robotics-specific course in OMSCS.\nAssignments are fun, all coded in Python, straightforward and pretty easy. If you put in any effort at all getting 100% on all of the assignments is not difficult. You are GIVEN the solutions to all of the homework assignments, meaning at the very least you are guaranteed 100% on all HWs. The final exam was fair and relatively straight forward. I didn't really study and managed a 70%, while zipping through it in 30 minutes. Because the exam is only worth 10% of your grade, if you've gotten 100% on all previous assignments you can essentially skip the final and still get an A in the class (hence my casual approach to the final).\nKeep in mind that although there is no required hardware component for this class, there are some extra credit hardware-related projects you can elect to work on yourself. Although I had planned on doing them, I ended up not having time. Which is sad, considering I came to OMSCS hoping to move into Robotics. But, se la vie.\nAlso keep in mind the term \"AI\" is used extremely loosely here. A better name for this course would be \"Robotics Fundamentals: A Brief Overview of Robotics Basics\" ... you will not be coding any complex AI algorithms, you will not be learning about control theory (this class covers PID only), you will not be doing any neural networks or computer vision related autonomous robo tasks. This class covers the bare minimum to know the general basics of the Robotics world. If you've never ever learned anything about robotics programming in the past this is a lovely course to get up to speed. If you HAVE taken any kind of robotics course in the past, you won't get anything new out of AI4R.\nAs others here have noted, Jay Summet and the TAs for this class were all amazing. Great weekly office hours, wonderful support on Piazza. Unfortunately, you won't have the pleasure of meeting Sebastian.\nTL;DR. If you're at all interested in Robotics, and looking for a general overview of the space (no deep dives here!), this class is great. Sebastian is an amazing guy, I love him, but you may sometimes find his lectures too simplistic (for a graduate program, anyway). Projects are fun and easy. With any non-zero amount of effort you will get an A in the class. No book and no readings required.",

Prep beforehand might be helpful, but isn’t necessary as the course gives you ample time if you start early. If you do want to prepare, I suggest a brief review of linear algebra (basic matrix operations), trigonometry, and Python. I was a STEM undergrad, so I picked up the concepts fast, but again, they give you ample time and some alternative resources to help you out as needed.\nI personally feel I learned a lot (if you want to deepen your understanding feel free to buy the textbook). The course provides you insight into applying probability to solve robotic problems relating to uncertainty in measurement, planning, and control. If you want a brief warmup to AI, I suspect this will help you a little since it covers linear algebra, probability, as well as A* search.',

Why it is hard, it is not because of the coding algorithm, but how to get started, since the description does not give enough details, and you need to read through the test codes to understand what is being asked for. I usually have no clue on how to get start, and have to read through piazza to understand more. It is a tricky and hard course, honestly saying. Maybe if you are familiar with Python, this course maybe easy for you.',

With the right level of motivation you could easily complete all the projects in 4 weeks.\nThe topics are interesting but they do not go into enough depth.\nThe class could definitely be improved by just adding additional layers to the topics that are covered such as including unscented and extended kalman filters and how to handle non-linear equations of motion for particle filters.

            review: "This is a great first class. The lecture videos are good enough to solve the assignments but not good enough to help us understand the underlying math in depth. You can choose to read the Probabilistic Robotics book to understand the math but it is very time-consuming as the videos are much in sync with the book. Tutorials by Leo and Chris are very very useful in filling this gap. I wish these tutorials were available for all the topics and not just 2. The assignments are very interesting and thought-provoking. Do read piazza conversations before starting the assignments. It is not very difficult to get an A. Though I missed an A just by a percent as I couldn't complete the SLAM project on time. The average workload varies as watching videos does not take a long time whereas assignments do.\nHardware and research challenges can be taken up if you are interested. Great job by professors and TAs.",

Granted it was my first class, so I didn't know what to expect. But really, the videos are kind of sparse and to do well, it requires quite a bit of work to get through the projects. My advice is to use the help from fellow students on Piazza and Slack well and work your way up iteratively towards the solution. I for one should have worked much harder. That said, getting an A in the course should be more than possible if you see all the work through. Each of the 4 projects has 15% assigned to it. So not being able to finish them will effect your grade BIG time.\nFor the motivated ones, the course is a great introduction to some commonly used robotics algorithms. So if you set aside twice the amount of time, you can read through the textbook, research papers, participate in the optional project and engage in discussions on Piazza. The rewards for doing all this will be a phenomenal amount of learning.\nKnowing Python, debugging using PyCharm and Linear Algebra helps.",

Most of the concepts were new for me, and this class gave a great overview of the topics. I loved the format. Each lecture would have some code snippets that you should definitely try in your local IDE. Then the homework assignments built on those code snippets. If you copied them over to the assignment, then just tweaked a few sections the homework was finished. The project was then built from the homework. Copy the code again, add a few more things and variable tweaking and the project would be mostly finished. The projects were fun and most included graphics so you could see the various localization and filters working in real-time.\nThey did add a final exam this semester, but it was very fair. It was 10% of the grade, and if you are putting time into the projects you could have 100% going into the final and not even have to take it. They allowed two tries on the final.',

            review: "Artificial Intelligence for Robotics felt much too simplistic for a college Master's level course. The video lectures were very short, only shallowly covering the often very-technical subjects. I felt this style gives students the illusion of mastering the subjects without really understanding or being able to apply the concepts.\nThe biggest upside to the course is that the grades are entirely project-based, and you are allowed to repeatedly submit your projects to the grading site (GradeScope) to continually iterate and improve. This style of evaluation mirrors the real world where you have to solve problems and often have the change to improve on initial attempts. The projects were well-thought out and interesting to complete, although as with the class as a whole, they were a little too easy, mostly consisting of filling in blanks in the code scaffold provided.\nOverall, this was an enjoyable class, but felt too easy which is reflected in the fact that I barely remember much of the content because we weren't forced to deeply engage with the subjects. This is probably a good course to take as one of your first, or along with another course provided you are proficient in Python (which is used exclusively in the projects). If you are looking for an enjoyable and low-effort introduction to a few algorithms used in robotics, then this class will suit you, but for anyone seeking out a rigorous class that will lead to understanding, this course doesn't satisfy.",

I spent around 10 hours a week on average, but I would spend around 2-5 hours on some weeks, and when trying to do the projects, I would crank out 10 hours over a weekend. It totally depends on how you want to work, as the projects are given really far in advance, so you could just knock out the projects in the beginning of the semester. The content is a little bit dated, and I don't feel like I learned too much, since the lectures don't really go deep into why/how the techniques actually work. The final is super easy, and if you start the projects in advance, you should be sitting at close to an A (even if you don't take the final), since the final is 10% of your grade.\nI have a more in-depth video review, where I walkthrough the projects here: https://youtu.be/pe4EnivoRHk",

Overall, I liked the class because the material was pretty interesting. If you have a background in linear algebra and Python, this course would really only need 5 hours a week to get an A. I even finished all the projects ~4 weeks ahead of time. I did spend 10 hours per week though because I forced myself to read the textbook and some relevant papers to learn more (unnecessary). A final was added to this class this semester that some people stressed about, but honestly it was there to check if you got the gist of what was taught, nothing deep was tested. They gave us 45 mins to do 25 questions, but I managed to finish in less than 10 mins.\nPros:\n\nCourse content/subject was pretty interesting\nProjects were pretty fun\nNot super demanding\nTAs were nice and active in Piazza\nSlack channel was helpful\n\nCons:\n\nLecture videos were very superficial. Only gives you the surface level details of the algorithms and very little mathematical explanation (even though the subjects were actually very math heavy). I had to supplement the lecture videos with youtube videos and reading the textbook to make it feel like I was learning graduate level material. Note it was not necessary to do this to get an A in the course, the lecture videos sufficed\nProblem sets didn't really teach us much\n\nAs you can see, there were a lot more pros than cons, but I would say that first con really disappointed me as I felt like I wasn't learning much when the material could've been so much deeper and richer.",

            review: "This is my 4th course in the program (after SDP, Info Sec and Networks) and by far the best course so far. The course is very well structured with very helpful and courteous TAs and Instructor, which is not always the case with OMSCS classes. The projects were all very interesting and challenging.\nI took it in Fall 2020 and the format has changed from previous semesters in that now we were required to take a final exam which was cumulative and was 10% of the final grade. There were 5 projects in the class (Asteroids, Mars Glider, PID (mini project), Warehouse and SLAM). There were also 6 problem sets related to the lecture videos, which had the answers available so it was more for supplementing the learning rather than really testing. The projects and problem sets are graded via Gradescope so that I knew exactly the grade I would get on each project,  no surprises there.\nI probably spent about 20 hours on all projects but the PID, which took maybe 10, including watching the lecture videos. Overall I found the Asteroids and Mars Glider problems to be most time consuming and 'harder'. They also involved a bit of parameter tuning which was cumbersome and takes a bit of time. Definitely start these earlier and do not wait until the last minute (like I always do). PID was probably the most boring project because it required tuning PID controller without much coding. Warehouse was my favorite project - we implemented A* and Dynamic Programming for moving a robot in a warehouse and picking up and delivering boxes. The final SLAM project wasn't bad either. It did seem that it may have troubled more students than the previous ones, but it could be that it was near finals + Thanksgiving so maybe people just started a bit later than the earlier projects.\nThe final exam is new and was just introduced this semester. It is a comprehensive exam that included material from all covered lectures. We had two attempts to take it and the highest score was chosen. I personally, found the exam to be very fair. It was multiple choice/ T/F + a few simple calculation questions. Closed notes, closed everything. I watched the lectures throughout the semester in order to do the projects. I was able to score >80 without any preparation or reviewing. Keep in mind that it is only 10% of the grade and if you do well on the remainder of the projects you may not even need to take it.\nSome students had mentioned about a disconnect between lectures, problem sets and then projects. I do agree to an extent, because it seemed that while the projects were very well structured, the instructions themselves always left me with the 'How do I start this?' question in my mind. It seemed like we were given a some code for each project and instructions on what needs to be accomplished. Quite a few times I just had to go and step through the tester code in debug mode to figure out exactly what's going on, what the set up is and how to approach the problem, because the instructions were not explaining any of it.\nFor example, for the very first project, the Asteroids, I knew what I need to do in terms of applying Kalman Filter, but I needed to google quite a bit to figure out exactly how to set the problem up because it was not explained and if you don't know / don't remember motion models then it was not really clear. However, the TAs and Instructor were so helpful which made figuring out what is needed easier.\nOverall great class!",

Doing the SLAM project after lectures left a lot of people completely lost. The upside is the instructor and TAs are incredibly active on Piazza and fill in the gaps. They also held office hours that answered questions and gave tutorials over topics.\nThe projects were posted in the first couple of weeks and many finish early - I was done in early November, but I probably would have been done earlier if I hadn't also been taking CP. They added a final exam this year, but it's only worth 10% so most people aimed for a perfect score on all the projects so they could skip it. I don't know if they'll keep it at 10% in the future.\nThe projects usually took me at least a few days to complete - I have a strong background in Python and a CS degree, so YMMV. I don't know that I would call them easy, but they were so spaced out that even when they took some time to figure out, you still had free time.\nMy main regret with this class was pairing it with CP. I was able to comfortably do both, but I didn't have any time to do the hardware challenge - applying algorithms learned in the course to a small robot you built.",

Assignments are crisp and validate your understanding from the lectures. TA hours are super helpful to complete assignments and I strongly suggest to get a kit to try yourself building a bot from the modules in this course. It will be super fun.',

            review: "This was my second OMS course and I came from a non-CS major. The first project was a bit challenging at the beginning because I was not used to OOP and modifying a piece of code among a big pile of files. Once I went through the first stage the rest of the course became a breeze. I ended up completing all my projects within the first 3 weeks into the class, and in another 2 weeks I even completed the optional hardware challenge. For the rest six weeks I was left with basically nothing to do and at the end of the summer I felt I already forgot a good part of knowledge learned from this course...\nThat being said, all the projects were well designed and served as a major part of the learning. I don't really like the video lectures. Those are broken into a million pieces with coding \"quizzes\" so it's not coherent and consistent at all in terms of what we code about. Maybe it's just me but I would prefer to sit down and listen to a continuous lecture before diving into coding, rather than switching back and forth like every 2 minutes.\nOverall, this could be a good course to pair up with another. Again the projects in the course are very high-quality and entertaining to work with.",

            review: "The course concepts are interesting and informative. They also translate extremely well to the projects which I feel is a strong plus. The main negative with this class, is that there is a heavy emphasis on parameter tuning. Almost every project focuses on modifying values and almost no code/logic creation. It's as simple as given a function definition, fill it up and tweak values until it passes. I have on average spent 3-4 hours coding/testing and the rest of the time parameter tweaking. So be warned it's quite annoying and stressful. Other than that the projects are not only interesting but largely applicable to real world scenarios. The weekly problem sets are easy as some have mentioned it's to check your understanding not to necessarily grade you. They also added a final exam, so that's a new downer for most. Study study study! Still it's a fun class, difficulty isn't as hard as most but tedious.The professor is knowledgeable, but don't expect him nor the TAs to give you big help, this class is definitely a lot of independent study.\nThey are helpful on piazza, and office hours though :)\nOne thing that is really terrible is this is they ONLY real robotics class. The concepts are great, but this is sadly as far as you'll go if you do a CP&R spec. So definitely take it because this is about as deep as it goes for robotics in this masters. If you want to know what algorithms drive a lot of systems, or even how sensors work, and how they differ from what you'll learn in here, the TAs help with that! It was really a great experience.\nOverall, take it, it's a good class.",

            review: "This has easily been my favorite class of the OMSCS so far. It is a really straightforward class and everything was opened on day 1 so it was easy to work ahead.\nTldr; take this class, you will learn a lot and get to apply your knowledge.\nLectures:\nStandard format video lectures (Udacity). Dr. Thrun does a great job of explaining the intuitions behind concepts I have struggled to grasp in the past (PID, Kalman Filters, etc.) that make the class really worthwhile. However, they won't make you an expert in any particular field taught. It just gives you a great jumping off point to learn more.\nProblem Sets:\nEach lecture concludes with a problem set that has to be completed for a grade. Gradescope made this a really straightforward process. The problem sets reinforced the concepts from the lectures but even if you got really stuck you could just click \"View Answer\" in Udacity which would give you the solution. You should not need to ever rely on that and I did not. It's really just a matter of working the problem till you have it.\nAssignments:\nThis to me is the best part of the class. The TA/Professor provided assignments forced me to truly understand the concepts taught in the lectures. The assignments were realistic and plausible to the point where you can see how your solution would work in the real world. Be prepared to spend the most amount of time on these, especially since they will be harder to do if you don't already have a firm grasp of the concepts involved.\nThankfully, the TAs on Piazza were extremely helpful at answering questions and provided a ton of resources right off the bat so that students can better understand concepts like SLAM (YouTube videos, papers, etc)",

            review: 'The lectures were good but superficial - They have been developed with the intent of walking us through the code for a few algorithms. We were expected to build black boxes that magically work when they are given the right set of hyperparameters. There wasn\'t enough theory to explain the working principle behind the concepts that were taught, making the lectures less useful. The lecture content can pretty much be condensed to 6 medium blogs. (There are a lot of blogs that are directly based out of lectures.) You should be ready for a lot of self-learning if you really have to "understand" the concepts, although that need not be done to succeed in this course.\nThe instructor (Prof. Jay) and TAs were super helpful. The office hours were good. There were a lot of instances on Piazza that proved that the instructor really cared for the students.\nThe projects were really helpful and are of medium difficulty. Most of the projects can be completed during weekends.',

            review: "I read this course was in the medium category, but I think they upgraded it as we keep posting on OMScentral and they use that information against us. I found it very difficult and time consuming and I had a strong Python background going in, I think their goal is to make every single course hard or extremely hard to take out those without 10+ years of professional experience. The course was interesting by I lost it by the time we got to A* search, I felt like I was throwing darts in the dark and luckily passed with a low B. The good part though was I am no longer thinking of a career path in robotics; so this class did save me many years in that regard.\nIf you are passionate about the subject and ready to work on on some painful algorithm designs from scratch, it's a good course but don't expect the Professor to really be on piazza, he just does the office hours when he can and it's the TA's running the show.",

Those reviews are probably from long time software devs, in which case this class is an absolute joke and shouldn’t be taken unless if you want an easy A.\nAs someone who’s not a software dev and is taking this class as their second course, this class helped refine my python skills and I think provided me a good foundation to take some of the tougher classes this program has to offer. One week would be an “off” week we’re I’d only work one day a week on the lectures and problem sets. The next week would be an “on” week where I’m grinding through a project. The TAs for this class of mostly great and do provide help when asked!\nI think the schedule of projects makes this course a great summer class.',

            review: 'I want to double down with the other review stating the following: "The Projects expand on what you were asked to do in the Problem Sets which expand on what you were asked to do in the Lectures. Once you figure out the ways in which they\'re asking you to expand/generalize things at each step, it becomes pretty straightforward to figure out what you need to do."\nThis is exactly how the class will run, though the biggest downside to the class is how the Udacity lectures will gloss over some of the deeper math. If you have had a linear algebra class or two, you should be able to troubleshoot well enough. Additionally, if you\'d like to go into the math, you can of course buy Dr Thrun\'s book, which is the class textbook. It\'s all about how much you want to get out of it.\nDr. Summet does a fantastic job engaging with the class through office hours and piazza, the TAs and classmates were helpful, and the content/projects were interesting. I would definitely recommend this class as an enjoyable survey of some base robotic techniques. I personally plan to use it as a springboard into some more advanced self-study, as robotics is my intended career pivot from Controls/Electrical Engineering.\nI also diligently tracked my hours through out the course and ended up with an A in the class and a 98+ on each project. I\'m not a software developer and would rate my Python abilities as intermediate.\nProject 1: Kalman Filters - Asteroids\n-Recommended Estimate: 15-25 hours\n-Actual: 22 hours (Estimation: 10, Navigation: 12)\n-Description: This was the most difficult project for me, though the class consensus was that the second project was the most difficult. This was my first programming assignment past easy scripting or online refresher basics courses since I graduated from undergrad in 2013 though. The objective was to estimate the future location of moving asteroids so you can pilot a ship around them.\nProject 2: Particle Filters - Mars Glider\n-Recommended Estimate: 15-25 hours\n-Actual: 20 hours (Estimation: 14, Navigation: 6)\n-Description: This project has you use a particle filter by creating many estimates of your glider, and using survival-of-the-fittest techniques to have them cluster around your actual location. This project required some parameter tuning to account for noise and uncertainty, which added quite a bit of time.\nProject 3 (Mini-Project): PID - Rocket\n-Recommended Estimate: 5-15 hours\n-Actual: 6 hours (Pressure: 2, Rocket: 2, Biprop: 2)\n-Description: This is actually something I do for work as a Controls Engineer, so I already had the intuition for the P, I, and D gains. Tuning this one by hand was relatively easy, though a lot of the students used an optimization algorithm called "Twiddle", that you could code as a wrapper to spit out optimized numbers. So, this project has tuning as well though not as brutal. You are controlling the fuel and and pressure levels to a rocket so it can take off and land without crashing into the ground or running out of fuel.\nProject 4: Search - Warehouse\n-Recommended Estimate: 10-20 hours\n-Actual: 6 hours (A-star: 4, Dynamic Programming: 2)\n-Description: The numbers are misleading on this one, everything just seemed to fall into place for me, kind of by accident it almost felt like. This was a fun project with no tuning, where are you finding an optimized path through a warehouse to deliver boxes. Apparently this project has been made more in line with the other, difficulty-wise, in recent semesters by having it in discrete instead of continuous space.\nProject 5: SLAM - Gem Finder\n-Recommended Estimate: 15-25 hours\n-Actual: 16 hours (SLAM: 9, Navigate: 5, Estimate: 2)\n-Description: This project puts everything together, though you don\'t actually use the algorithms from the previous projects. In this project, you are given no map or directions, and have to locate and "extract" gems from the ground by sensing your surroundings and estimating both your own location as well as the gems themselves. Hence "SLAM": Simultaneous Localization and Mapping.\nIn conclusion, would recommend! Fun class.',

            review: "This class was fun but it has its quirks.\nThe lectures were ported over from Udacity and predate OMSCS by a couple years. As those who know him know, sometimes Dr. Thrun is a little bit hard to understand. Also, he has a way of leaving a sometimes laughably easy trail of breadcrumbs which then lead you off a cliff, after which he praises you effusively. It's a very disorienting educational experience.\nOn the one hand, the pedagogical scaffolding herein is very effective: the Projects expand on what you were asked to do in the Problem Sets which expand on what you were asked to do in the Lectures. Once you figure out the ways in which they're asking you to expand/generalize things at each step, it becomes pretty straightforward to figure out what you need to do.\nOn the other hand, since many of these \"techniques\" rely on heavy math that isn't explained in much detail, we're kind of just implementing magic with a shallow understanding. This also makes it hard to debug / for your fellow students to help you if you make an error somewhere.\nDownside: Because we're dealing with noisy systems, there's a lot of parameter tuning. And because our grading systems rely on RNG's, you often have to submit multiple times to get maximal points. These two facts also sometimes make it hard to know if its your code or your parameters that are off the mark, which can get very frustrating.\nUpside: Most all of the Problem Sets / Projects are released very early on, which makes it possible to work ahead, and there are no exams. Thus, I finished this class in just over five weeks.\nA kind of unsatisfyingly shallow educational experience -- especially considering that it's one of the few OMSCS classes that deal with Robotics -- but makes for a fairly stress-free semester, and an enjoyable introduction.",

            review: "This is an excellent summer class (or a 2nd class if you're doubling up).\nUnderstandably, the unfavorable reviews point to the quality of the lecture videos as the main reason for their rating, but if you view the videos as overviews/introductions to the topics being discussed,  they become enjoyable.\nThe meat of the class is in the projects, which despite having a lot of tuning, are excellent in their design.  Despite the tuning required, the class doesn't have the busy work found in other classes. The testing suites and visualizations provided were superb.\nIt helps that the instructors are all excellent, with Dr. Summet leading an awesome team of TAs.  They are very deeply involved and responsive to all queries in both Piazza and OH.\nI would suggest getting the textbook by Dr. Thurn which discusses the topics in depth to supplement their shallow coverage in the videos. The supplemental resources provided by the instructional team were also a great help.\nDespite the 8-hour average I put in, that doesn't reflect the projects difficulty.  I still spent considerable time on them.  However, since the projects were release during the first two weeks, and with no exams and busy work in the class, I was able to finish the class with the maximum score possible, 7 weeks ahead of schedule, without really feeling that I rushed it (I just kept the same pace I did for the 2 previous classes I had taken before by working a couple of hours every day and longer during the weekends).\nSo, in summary, it was great - I felt like I learned a lot, got introduced to very interesting topics, and it didn't cost me my summer.",

            review: 'This course is a lightweight introduction into some probabilistic robotics / AI topics, namely: uni-modal / multi-modal localization techniques, Kalman filter, Particle filter, search (shortest path finding, A*), PID control and Graph SLAM.\nThe theory presentation is on the level of YouTube how-to-s in terms of academic depth (i.e. not deep at all), but the projects and the homework are well arranged to help appropriate understanding of the iceberg tip for those topics. As a background, this was my first course into any AI/robotics related field (both education and various professional career wise), so I’m mostly happy I took this course as a primer.\nI liked getting through and study the course material, doing the projects, getting exposed to what Sebastian Thrun has to offer as a professional in the field. Unfortunately I consider the lecture quality and their academic instruction approach as substandard, which is a shame given what Thrun has achieved as an innovator and especially as a founder of Udacity and one of the founders of OMSCS.\n\n"The Good"\n\nAs mentioned above, exposure to Sebastian Thrun experience and ideas related to robotics, self-driving cars, presented topics and AI aspects in general. In some of the lecture visualizations and recorded Q/A there were important insights he shared. We also had two direct office hours with him, which mostly covered high-level topics, which was great.\nTeaching staff on-site – excellent, can’t praise them enough. Dr. Jay Summet – flawless instructor, knowledgeable, explains things in excellent way, very much involved, including on Piazza, on regular basis, constantly provides helpful material and theory intuition behind things, supplied an elaborate list of useful resources to cover the gaps in the lectures and for further exploration.\nAll the TA-s were very professional, technically and personally, helpful and involved. Office hours were held every week (and recorded), some topics were covered as special tutorials, again to cover the gaps in lectures.\nThe course structure is thought through well, most of the praise here should go to Sebastian, presumably. The projects and the homework integrate and compliment the studied material.\nThere are nice quizzes in the lectures, with supplied code (often not exemplary quality or efficiency) which you can incorporate into the projects – a lot of time was invested into those, and they are helpful and show the ways to do things. That was the best thing about the lectures, and those techniques I found useful.\nI enjoyed all the projects (5 projects, 1 of those being “mini” with lesser scope – one project per topic), the project themes and infrastructure are nicely put together, I could see the concepts working, also using the supplied visualization infra.\nLike others have said, there are no exams, and you submit all of the homework and projects to Gradescope, with unlimited submissions, so you control your grade. It was my only course so far where I’m going to get a three-digit grade average (with the extra credit only on two projects and only being a single point), and it wasn’t hard – it all depends on time and effort you invest. Homework (6 problem sets, mostly pretty easy) have Udacity solutions (I would try doing the homework without looking at those), so it really aims at how you learn.\nNice Python practice was there for me (I haven’t been exposed to it that much on a professional front).\nEven for a summer course (it had the same material as the fall/spring version), there was never a real time pressure, even for a person with other time commitments. All the homework and projects were released upfront, and some people finished the course within two weeks (not me).\n\n"The Bad"\n\nMost of the projects which included noise modelling often carried a lot of tuning which was not well guided. At the end, sometimes things depended on luck, of how persistent you are with Gradescope submissions (different results with the same code).\nGranted, the tuning and related thinking is expected to be significant in related engineering, I just felt it was not guided well enough and the amount of time you spent on it sometimes depended on luck, so the learning value was diminished.\n\n"The Very Bad"\n\nThe lectures quality.\nFirstly, the theory presentation approach is mostly of a MOOC for a general audience - sometimes a teaser approach for things you would like to learn if interested in. Maybe that\'s why the course was recently renamed into "techniques" one, but still it was not what I expected from an academic course at this level.\nYes, Sebastian references his book and some other resources as a place where those topics “have proofs”, but one could do the search online as well, you don’t need a course for that. Yes, it’s valid to direct the students to a proper course text book chapters for study, but that was not how the course was designed and articulated.\nLike I said, it was my first encounter with the topics, and I spent long hours studying material from other sources, in order to understand the intuition behind the math and theory for some of the topics. So for those who, as I heard, attacked people expressing a similar opinion about lectures (not me) with “you get what you put into it” – it was not the case, people did put a lot of effort in (and honestly, I could do the projects and get the same 100-s even without going into depth).\nLuckily, the lecture slides and other course pages contained quite useful pointers (must be appended by Summet and the rest of instruction staff) – use it. KF lecture, for example, was the worst, so do look into “ilectureonline” series mentioned at the end of the lecture, that was invaluable for me to understand the theory behind, if the topic is new for you.\nThe second reason for the lectures not being up to standard is that those are riddled with errors and inaccuracies. Other courses have occasional errata on the lectures, but not like here. Almost every lecture has multiple places where there are errors in details and formulas, with frequently appended corrections by the teaching staff. It’s quite representative that in one quiz, Sebastian says “yeah, the way I present it is kinda sloppy, but, well, who cares :) “ – and then, the same sloppiness propagates to the suggested solution, which is incorrect (but being corrected as an erratum notice at the bottom of the quiz).\nThe quizzes and related techniques were good and useful, as I mentioned, but the python code quality was not exemplary to say the least, not a good instructional example.\n\nAll in all, the course is a nice intro to the topics, look into “the Good” section if you seek the positives – I wish I could recommend this course more than I do. If Jay Summet, for example, would create his own set of lectures with the way he explains and values the theory, same topics and assignments remaining, this course could be excellent.',

I am not complaining because I needed a second easy course to pair but it's a wasted opportunity of what could have been a very good course. The assignments themselves are okay. Nothing too amazing but also very well put together.\nHowever, the lack of theory makes this course not worth it. 80% of this course is covered in more depth in AI and CV. The remaining 20% is a 10 min lecture by Sebastian. You are almost better off just learning SLAM on your own.\nOne good thing. Jay is amazing and very well engaged. The best prof I've had in OMSCS.

The difficulty of the class will probably depend on your background. If you are familiar with Python, linear algebra, and statistics you probably won't have too much trouble.\nI recommend watching the lectures and completing the problem sets before the semester starts. Most of the coursework is released within the first two weeks of the semester, which is really nice if you like to work ahead. I was able to finish the class about a month before the semester ends.\nAsteroids and Mars Glider were the most time consuming and difficult projects. PID, Search, and SLAM were a lot more straightforward. Spend time understanding the lecture quizzes and problem sets as they will be helpful for completing the projects. Start working on the projects early, and pay attention to Slack and Piazza.\nOverall, I would definitely recommend this class. The material is interesting, the projects are fun, there are no exams, and you can work ahead. This is a great course to take in the Summer.",

            review: "**My Background: **\nBachelor's in Engineering, Large Research University in the US.\nTook 4 undergraduate CS courses.\nI don't work in a CS-related job and I haven't coded at all outside of school work.\nThis is my third course in the OMSCS program, after CP and DVA.\n**Difficulty: **\nThis class is by far the easiest course I have taken. I timed myself very closely and the entire course took me 49.5 hours. That's ~5 hours per week in the summer semester and ~3 hours per week in the spring or fall. The class is entirely project based and they released all of the material in the first two weeks of class, so you can work ahead and finish everything early if you want to (I finished the class in 4 weeks). The projects were the most difficult part of the class, but they were straightforward implementations of what was taught in the lectures, so they were quite easy. Two of the undergraduate classes I took were harder than this course (Computer Architecture and Programming Methodology). This class can be easily paired with any other class, as long as you are decent at Python.\n**Course Quality: **\nThe course is very well run. The TAs are really helpful and are very active on Piazza. The course content is interesting, but not too deep or complicated. The lecture videos are VERY useful and aren't unnecessarily long. I didn't have to do any studying whatsoever outside of what was presented in the videos. The only problem I had with the lecture videos was that they didn't bother explaining any of the math behind each of the algorithms they taught. The videos were purely focused on how to implement them, so you would have to go elsewhere to understand the underlying theory.\n**Breakdown of My Time: **\n\nTotal --- 49.5 hours\nLecture Videos & Piazza --- 13.5 hours\nProblem Sets --- 10 hours\nProject 1: Asteroids --- 5 hours\nProject 2: Mars Rover --- 10 hours\nMini-Project: PID Control --- 1.5 hours\nProject 3: Search --- 5 hours\nProject 4: SLAM --- 4.5 hours\n\n**Tips: **\n\nIf you aren't solid on Python coding, solidify your skills before starting the course.\nMake sure you understand the lecture videos and problems sets well before starting the projects. If you do, the projects are not complicated to implement.\nEven though they provide the solution to the problem sets, do not look at them until you have really tried to implement it yourself.\nFeel free to reuse problem set code on the projects (cite it properly), since the projects are all built upon the same algorithms\nBe prepared to spend hours trying to optimize the parameters of each algorithm used in the projects. Half of the time that I spent on each project was focused on tweaking parameters. Poor parameter choices can result in a 0% for your grade and small tweaks can boost your grade to 100% (as long as your algorithm is properly implemented).\n",

            review: 'TL;DR: Well designed course, great professor & TA involvement, quite manageable.\nThis is my fifth course, and by far my favorite. No tricky questions on exams to deal with, just programming projects. Some projects require tuning, which can be frustrating, but as you go, you think more deeply about what is happening and you can tune smarter. Professors (both Dr. Summet and Dr. Thrun) participate in Office Hours. Dr. Summet and TA\'s are active on Piazza. Lectures are interesting, but the background is left out, leaving work for you to do, if you want to understand more, which is great for a grad level class. Problem sets on Udacity are 26% of the grade. Many answers are walked through by professor Thrun, so you get to do your own work and check the answer. The concepts are later required in more depth in programming projects. I really liked this approach, and thought it was a great way to teach and reinforce new ideas. I hate to say "easy", as that\'s a reflection of your background and how far you stretch yourself, but if you start early enough and take advantage of Piazza and Slack, you should be able to meet the mark for a good grade. More importantly, you should find something interesting and challenging to think about and work on during this course.\nEdit:\nThere could be at least one more unit added to this class. and maybe a quiz or two over many of the lecture concepts would help make it more fulfilling / challenging. I have to change my rating of the class to easy, until more projects / assignments are added. Also, my estimate of time/week is based on my estimate of the time I spent prior to finishing the class 5 weeks before the final project due date.',

If you like coding and learning about algorithms that are used in the real world, you will enjoy this course.\nThe projects were a bit tricky at times, but I was very interested so I didn't find it very difficult to work through it and get a very high grade on each one.",

            review: 'I thoroughly enjoyed taking this class this semester. The lectures were structured nicely—I thought the topics were presently very clearly and successfully provided the proper intuition to approach the topics. I think the key to doing well in this class is to have a fairly strong math background (there is a lot of Linear Algebra) and have good object-oriented programming skills. The projects are entirely in Python, but any OO experience in a modern language (Java, C, etc.) should lend itself useful here. I personally program in Java, and my Python is fairly intermediate, but I didn’t find it too difficult to work on the assignments.\nThe homework sets are presented in the Udacity videos directly, and technically the answers are already provided. But don’t take this as an opportunity for “free points,” take this as an opportunity to really learn how to implement the topics and appreciate that you get immediate feedback to help guide you.\nThe projects are much bigger and more complicated versions of the homework. There is usually some premise to the project---for the Kalman filter, we were guiding a ship through an asteroid field, for Particle Filter, we were trying to locate a glider across rocky terrain, etc. The projects will really test your ability to apply the topics. I found them to be quite fun and engaging. I think the TA’s do a phenomenal job at building the testing suite where you can test your implementation locally. For the Particle Filter, for example, it was incredibly satisfying to watch the particles successfully find the glider and accumulate around it! I also appreciate that the projects are submitted through Gradescope and you get immediate feedback on the performance of your implementation. You also have to option to choose your highest grade, as long as you submit and choose before the project deadline.\nThe instructors are very active in the class. I think this is one of the few classes (I’ve taken 7 classes before this one) where the actual professor participates so actively in helping the students on the forums and office hours. Overall, this is a pretty great class to take, in general. I personally took this as an elective and I’m happy I did.',

            review: "This is my first course in OMSCS and I would recommend this course for one of the first course options. The course content and projects are interesting and reasonable. This course uses Python 3 and I am a Python newbie, but it's perfectly fine and you can learn as you go. Piazza is super helpful if you are stuck with the project. TAs and the instructor are all very active, and office hour is definitely helpful.\nIn this course, you will learn about Kalman Filter, Particle Filter, Search method(A* and DP), PID control and SLAM. To be honest I believe the content in this course is just the surface of the self driving technology, but it provides a starting point and back ground knowledge if you are interested in this domain. The working load is absolutely manageable and it's a gentle start for this program in my opinion.\nMy tips for this course are start the project early and check Piazza often. I basically found everything I need on Piazza. Don't do the project in the last minute since there are still some tricky points in the projects.",

But I would like to give a constructive feedback, so that if a TA or an instructor is reviewing, it would help them design the course better. Firstly, the TAs and Prof. Summet is extremely helpful. But I felt that the projects lacked a well defined structure. You would probably spend hours resolving bugs and in fine tuning parameters blindly. What could really help is a proper structure and more rich test cases, that would give an indication of were the student is going wrong. The visualization provided does help you to tune the parameters to some extent but there should be a proper guideline of how to use these visualizations to tune the parameters. Another thing that can be improved is how these concepts are actually used in real life, how to tackle noisy measurements, how to monitor sensor values and report anomaly if any. I think these things can be covered in Office Hours with some minor demo from the TAs would make this course more interesting.",

            review: "Fairly easy class that introduces some interesting concepts. The lectures don't go very deep, so I would recommend some self-study if you want more than a high level tutorial of the concepts. This class doesn't have too many prerequisites (you could get by with just a decent grasp on Python), so I think it would be a good class for people who are new to the program or for those who don't have a CS background. Linear Algebra is mentioned as a prerequisite, but it doesn't really go beyond matrix multiplication.\nI wish the projects were more rigorous or had a larger scope. For the most part, they involved taking the code from the lectures and adapting them to take a different form of input or adding in a new dimension. Each project had a nice test suite that took away the guessing game of why you're getting good results locally but bad results on the online grader (I'm looking at you, GIOS).\nDr. Summet and the TAs were very active throughout the semester. If you're struggling with a project, then look through the Piazza questions or the office hours.\nOverall, this was a well-run class, but seemed to be lacking in content. I wish it either covered more topics, or went more in-depth on the current topics.",

There are 4 projects and 1 mini projects, 6 problem sets. No exams, yay :)\nI feel that a lecture contains too many quiz sections where you are interrupted and need to do by yourself, which was partly good but partly distracting to me.\nSo if you like Python programming this class would be enjoyable. The algorithm is kind of classic maybe, considering we don't see any machine learning techniques in this class for self driving. But still, I think those algorithms such as A* and DP etc we can learn in this class is useful basic tool as a software engineer.\nProblem sets can be done in copy and paste manner from lecture video. Projects are, I would say easy but not super easy. I definitely spent some nights scratching my head how I can apply an equation and / or logic I've  learnt in the class to the problems I need to solve. Also be prepared to do a lot of parameter tunings, which sometimes you may feel bit random but it's significantly important to improve your grade.\nThe class uses Gradescope for a submission and  the auto-grader just does its job well, so you can see your grade and progress in real time, which is very good.",

Actually, it might be a little bit misleading in that regard, because my understanding is that it's very unreasonable to expect many courses to go as well as this one did.\nIn terms of workload I think I put in probably 10-12 hours about every two weeks or so. Most of the rest of the time I was only sort of abstractly aware that I'm enrolled in school, so this course would pair very well with another.\nI found the topics to be very interesting even if they are treated a little bit superficially, and the professor and TAs are very active and very helpful on Piazza and in weekly office hours. The projects are well-defined and come with good test suites so you can know if you're likely to succeed before you ever submit anything.\nHaving some Python knowledge going in helps a lot, as does some exposure to Numpy (you never have to use Numpy, but it's helpful if you can), but I know at least one fellow student who knew nothing about either on day 1 and is still doing just fine.\nAs for linear algebra: if you can put together a transformation matrix that will pick pieces out of another matrix (i.e., you know how \"across the row, down the column\" works), and you have some idea of how systems of equations are solved with matrices, you're golden. If you don't know all that you'll have to learn it as you go, but it's entirely possible. You definitely don't have to be a linear algebra wizard.\nAll in all this is a very well-run course that was a lot of fun, and I absolutely recommend it.",

Answers are given to the homeworks in the lesson (the videos literally walk through the homework answers), which for me personally made it impossible to learn anything doing them.\nThe projects were implementations of the lessons/homeworks with a twist and were generally fun to do. The projects get a bit harder as the course goes, and I suspect them will beef up the final project after making part of it too easy this semester.\nIf you've never used Python you might struggle a bit, and there is a bit of linear algebra, but overall this is an easy class which I would recommend taking.",

The HW assignments were based on available lectures on Udacity (so you can get super ahead very easily) and the answers are given in lecture for the most part, only a few tweaks are necessary.\nI learned a lot in this class, and found the coding very fun and interesting, but I did not find it difficult at all. The hardest assignment was the first project, which took me maybe 8-10 hours to complete. The homeworks all take ~2 hours including lecture time.

            review: "It is a fun course but the last 2 projects are let downs.  Especially the last SLAM project, there is some math involved to convert a Gaussian error in polar coordinates to Cartesian but actually you can get around the math by just using an arbitrary value.  Also the Rocket PID project you can get away with just kind of plugging in values.  They admit that projects are in-the-works since apparently some students share them so it is unfortunate that the quality is lower than it could be if all students did not share past projects with each other or homework sites.  The lectures on Udacity are good for the basics but if you want to be a robotics programmer at the end of this, you'd have to get through the textbook and actually know the math.  I am going to end up with almost 100% (all 100's except one 98 on the first project) and I would not trust me to program a robot that does anything important yet.  More math would have been nice and that is a complaint I have about both CP and this course.  Having some stats background is a huge advantage as some of the projects require knowledge of basic concepts like normal distribution, central limit theorem.  The instructors are very good on Piazza, actually unbelievable in how responsive they are so I'm probably spoiled now.  But still some of the project components are a let down like navigation using heuristics.  Heuristics?  I have no idea what the AI in the name of the course is for.\nIf you're good in Python, Numpy and know some stats, easy A.  Otherwise it depends on what your skill level is as to work load and difficulty but I think doable except most projects are you either get most of it correct or you get almost no points.  Best preparation is probably just searching AI4R github repos for the free Udacity course, trying the quizzes on Udacity and see if you like it.",

            review: "Of all the classes I have taken in OMSCS, this by far my favorite course. I have seen over time that the reviews for this course have generally improved, and I can see why.\nYou will learn about Bayes Rule, Total Probability, Kalman Filters, Particle Filters, A*, Dynamic Programming, PID, SLAM, and more.\nFirstly, the lectures are very interesting and taught by Sebastian Thrun. Thrun has a nice way of presenting his material and bringing you slowly up to speed until you fully understand the concept being taught. There are a few lectures (Kalman Filters) where some of the lectures are a bit hand-wavy, but the office hours, TAs, and forums help to connect the dots. My favorite part of the lectures is that Udacity has built-in coding assignments that truly test your understanding of the lectures. These assignments connect well with the class projects, and I found myself referencing my old code quite often. The fact that the lectures align up with the assignments and projects perfectly makes this class feel even more spot on.\nThere are 6 problem sets that are easy to complete, test your knowledge of the lectures, and the lectures actually go over the solutions. I highly recommend doing these problem sets yourself before viewing your answer as your understanding will be tested in the actual projects.\nThere are 5 projects in the class, 3 medium sized, 1 small, and 1 larger. One of the projects is about guiding a ship through an asteroid field using Kalman Filters, one about getting a glider on mars to locate itself while only understanding it's location in terms of cliffs and its height with Particle Filters, one about Rocket PID controllers, one on getting a robot to pick up certain boxes in a warehouse with searching algorithms like DP and A*, and finally a SLAM project where you navigate a gem-finding robot.\nIf you don't think these types of projects are cool or fun...well I don't know what to say then. All of the projects are detailed, relevant to the lectures, and many have a useful visualization component. Projects can be submitted to GradeScope an infinite # of times, so you know exactly what you are getting on the project. Honestly, these were my favorite projects and they were a lot of fun.\nI'd like to comment on the TAs, the instructor, and the support as well. I have not found a class with better TAs or a more involved instructor.  The comments and the response rate from the TAs and instructor are second to none. There are no snarky or unhelpful comments, all of them are useful and educational. The office hours answer a lot of good questions, and the materials provided by Jay Summet and Leo Wilson should honestly be added to Udacity alongside the Kalman Filters. They help connect the dots on the Kalman Filter project.\nIn summary, this was a great class and a must take for anyone interested in CP&R, algorithms, or in search of a fun class where you will learn a lot. I'm honestly bummed that this class is over now, but I'm also motivated now; this class provided enough inspiration for me to pursue working in the AI for Robotics space.",

            review: "This was a great choice for my second class in OMSCS. Jay Summet does a great job of running an online class. He set clear expectations up-front, re. the assignments and grading. He has weekly office hours, which are good if you want some hints on the projects, and he's also active on Piazza, as are the TAs. The projects have clear instructions and good \"scaffolding\" code, so you won't expend excessive time fruitlessly trying to get someone else's code to work. Instead your focus is on learning the subject matter at hand so the projects are actually enjoyable. You'll need to put some effort in, but it's not ridiculous. The homework assignments are pretty easy because you can essentially use the code from the Udacity lectures (provided you cite it). The lectures are good, but I do agree with other reviewers that they are a bit simplistic and more, deeper lectures would help.",

            review: "TLDR; FUN course with a very involved teaching staff both on Piazza and in Office Hours.\nYou'll scratch the surface of AI concepts and algorithms for robotic navigation and get to actually write code that will execute some of the core concepts.\nInstructors: Dr. Jay Summet as the instructor, and the TAs, were involved and responsive to student questions on both Piazza and Office Hours.  You have no excuse for not getting the help you need in this course.\nLectures: Dr. Thrun's lectures lay down essential navigation concepts in a very easy way to understand.  If you need the additional details, there are a large breadth of resources you can lookup online, but almost everything you need to succeed in the projects comes directly out of the lectures and homeworks.\nAssignments:\n\n6 Homeworks that are closer to participation grades.  The main goal for them is to make you actually walk through the material a little yourself.\n5 Projects that are the meat of the course.  All in python, all with a well-built testing suite, and all with the opportunity for unlimited submits to the auto-grader.  I had quite a bit of fun with them, and think they really reinforced the concepts from the material as well as improved my python abilities\n\nExcellent pacing -- challenging and yet I haven't felt too rushed for any of our projects.  I would say the average of ~12 - 13 hours a week is accurate.\nThis could be a good \"First Course\", or paired with another course in the semester without too much struggle.\nThis is my 6th class in the program and probably one of my favorites so far!",

The amount of content covered is limited with only 6 topics but what makes this a medium difficulty course are the projects. There are 5 projects and except one (rocket PID), you'll spend 15+ hours each for 3 of them and about 25-30 hours for the Warehouse project. I do think the projects help students to really understand the content covered in the course.\nAlso this course is run by a very helpful professor (Dr. Summet) who literally answers every single question on piazza no matter how many times it has been repeated before.\nOverall this is a neatly run course and if you are a decent programmer, this won't be a difficult one.",

The answers to problem sets are all provided in the videos (free 28%).\nWith regarding to projects, the sample code demonstrated in the vidoes and problem sets provides a strong foundation for you to build upon. I would say 70% - 80% of the code necessary to complete the projects are provided. Parameter tuning can be a little bit time consuming but it is okay as it resembles real world applications.\nI think this is a good easy course if you want to relax and have some fun (who doesn't like robots lol). You will have plenty of time for each project so there is no rush at all. Overall I like the course!",

They are all VERY active on Piazza and Professor Jay himself hosts the live weekly office hours. I never knew this was out of the norm for OMSCS, but I am starting to realize that not all professors and TAs are quite that involved in their classes... The lectures can be rather high level and often don't directly apply to the projects, but I quite enjoyed this challenge of taking a concept and applying it to a different problem. If you ever get stuck, office hours/Piazza/Slack often provided the hints that I needed to get started. That being said, Dr. Thrun is an excellent lecturer and he makes a couple of live guest appearances throughout the semester to answer questions.\nYou'll have a combination of weekly homeworks and a few large projects due throughout the semester. There are no exams. As for the projects themselves, I thought they were all fairly interesting and well constructed with the exception that they still use Python 2.7. My only piece of advice is to start working on the projects ASAP (at least two weeks in advance, three for Warehouse) and you should have no problem with getting an A in the class as there is a lot of parameter tuning required sometimes to get the best results despite already having the correct implementation.",

There is a lot of noise parameter tuning, but from what I understand of the subject matter, this reflects real-world challenges with robots and sensors as well. Some projects were harder than others, but with solid office hours and piazza forums, none were unachievable. It was cool to have the chance to talk to Dr. Thrun, although a little gimmicky. His videos are pretty good though, I'd say. There are weekly homeworks, which you don't have to do (because of how they're structured the answers are given), but are highly valuable for the projects so worth doing. There are 4 main projects and one mini-project. All illustrate the material well, in my opinion, and none were too difficult. Recommended course for sure.",

There were certainly people who seemed to tackle the projects with ease, but they were right there the entire time helping their fellow students.  More experience would make things more manageable, but even with the skills, there are lessons for everyone in this course.\nLet me sum this up.  You are a GA Tech student! This means you are not afraid of hard work or challenging problems.  The course material is intriguing and immensely practical.  The lessons learned in the process will vary, but you will improve beyond the lessons taught in the classroom.  You could not get more relevant and interesting projects.  Give this course a shot if you are interested.  The course materials, professor, TAs, and other students will make this a course you will remember for a long time.  Good luck!",

As my first experience in OMSCS, this class is really good. You will have 6 problem sets, 4 projects, and one mini-project. No test or group projects. Problem sets are from Udacity and you are allowed to re-use the answer. Although you might need to modify the code a little bit to pass the test case. The first couple of projects were not too difficult but still challenging enough. You want to front-load as much as you can because most of the projects could take longer than you would expect. Make sure you fully understand the scope of the project before you even start, because the project description could be confusing. I think the most difficult one would be "warehouse" in my opinion. I got almost every project full score except for the Warehouse because of its difficulty and the fact that I took a week on vacation and fell a little behind for that project.\nMake sure you are comfortable with Python, Numpy, linear algebra, and probability.\nMake good use of Piazza, and also Slack. You will find your fellow students\' questions and responses helpful. The teacher and TAs were great.

The lectures overall were quite interesting and engaging (there were quizzes for almost every video to check your understanding) and the projects were really fun to complete. Don't get me wrong, they were really hard and time consuming but if you started early and read through tips/tricks on piazza, you were set up for success.\nOne awesome part of this course is how engaging the teaching staff is. I don't know if there were any unanswered questions on piazza and the responses were usually rather quick. Dr. Summet (the instructor for the course) is amazing and he seems really invested in this course and the students. The TAs attend the office hours that the course has weekly and they provide amazing insight. I love that there were structured virtual office hours since I haven't had those in any other courses. It bridged the gap between distance learning and on-campus learning tremendously for me. There are also auto-graders (bonnie) for the projects and while they reserve the right to rerun everything and not use bonnie, it was nice to know that your solution worked to some degree. The problem sets are a pretty easy gimme of 28% of your grade in that the solutions are provided in the relevant udacity video so that was also nice. Most of the code they provide for the psets helped you complete the projects.\nBe sure to use the course slack and piazza to help you get started on the projects. Be sure to submit completed files (and not the blank files that they provided :D). Be sure to start the projects early to get the most out of them AND to give yourself enough time to finish them. Truly, these projects were enjoyable to complete and the visualizations of your code were fun to watch.\nOverall, I was amazed by how smoothly and well run this course was and how present the TAs/instructors were. My standards for great OMSCS courses has gone up tremendously because of this course, Dr. Summet, the TAs, and the fun that I had in completing these projects.",

The TAs were all knowledgeable, nice, and involved as well. Dr. Summet led weekly office hours, which were all recorded, and the TAs were often involved in those as well.\nWe did five projects and six homework problem sets. There were no group projects, and the textbook wasn't necessary.

GPS has 2-8 m error, which is not acceptable in autonomous driving. You will learn and get to implement Kalman filter and Particle filter for this subject.\nSearch – to plan for the optimal path for your car to the destination. You will learn A* algorithm.\nPID – to have a better control on your car to move to the destination smoothly.\nSLAM – to implement the simultaneous localization and mapping.\nCombining all the algorithm above, you can build your own autonomous driving “toy” car!\n\nHWs and Projects\n\nThere are 6 HWs and 5 projects. No exam. Both HWs and projects are highly relevant to lectures. Actually answers to HW are basically given in the Udacity. You are encouraged to understand it and implement it in your way though. This class is all about the projects.\nProject 1 – You are a pilot of spacecraft. There are asteroids flying all over the place. Use Kalman filter to locate those asteroids and move your spacecraft to the safe zone – 15-20 hours for me.\nProject 2– Your robot is dropped from sky on Mars. Use Particle filter to locate your robot on the map (x, y, and z direction) during gliding before it hits the ground and crash! – 15-20 hours for me.\nProject 3 – A rocket is launched vertically and returns. Basically use P&ID control and tune its parameters to smoothly control its altitude  to match the desired path. – 10-15 hours for me.\nProject 4 – Now your robot is in the warehouse. Your robot has to move to and pick up boxes placed all over the warehouse and return to goal location and drop box. This is a routing problem. You will use A* or other algorithm of your choice to find the optimal path for the robot to complete this task. – 40-50 hours for me.\nProject 5 – This is a SLAM project. For projects 1-4, you are given a map. However, this time you will not be given a map. You will have to move around to destinations without map using simultaneous localization and mapping. – ~40 hours for me.\n\nOther comments\n\nAll projects use Python. If you want to practice your Python skill, then this is really a good option.\nHWs and projects are relevant to lectures. This makes your life easy.\nLectures, HWs and projects don’t go deep in theory. So if you are a serious learner for autonomous robotics, you will need to spend extra time to study the subject. You can find Sebastian’s textbook online.\nYou can front work. I saw some people were working on the last project in September.\nI tracked my hours accurately. On average I spent 12 hours per week for the 14 weeks.\nThe subject is pretty easy, but the challenge is coming from implementation to meet the target performance of your robot given in the projects.\n',

I highly recommend this class, even if you're in your first semester.",

            review: "This was my first OMSCS course and makes a good reintroduction to academic workload (it'd been eight years since college for me). I'd say the difficulty is similar to a Junior level CS course, it assumes you know basic Python, data structures, and some algos, but not terribly in depth. As long as you work reasonably ahead it's not too hard. It's very easy to get a B in the class, moderately hard to get a B.\nProbably my favorite aspect of the course is that it was ENTIRELY project based, and you can submit your project to an online autograder as many times as you want. No grade should ever be a surprise and you know where you're coming along in the project easily enough.\nThe 4.5 projects (one project is very simple) are:\n\n\nKalman Filters - Not too terrible, but this was my first graduate project and I didn't give it the time I expected.\n\n\nParticle Filters - IMO the hardest one, buffer time for it\n\n\nPID Control - Ridiculously easy, takes less than one day\n\n\nA* - Worth spending many hours on it as it's worth the most, many great resources online to help with A*\n\n\nGraph SLAM - Deceptively simple... if you decide to instead solve the project not as the lectures tell you to.\n\n\nA* is worth 20% of the grade, PID was worth 7%, the rest were 15% each. For the most part you can just use the lecture material to finish the assignments, but for the two filters there are some great online resources you should check out for help, and for A(star), I found implementing Theta* made it much easier to get a good grade. Just start the projects 1-2 weeks in advance and you'll be fine.\nThe TAs are very responsive on Piazza, but I found the Slack channel to be the most useful. Just subscribe to it and read what people are posting, it'll help you out. The optional textbook is pretty useless in my opinion, unless you really crave the in-depth math behind each project which isn't needed to do the projects, but interesting I suppose.",

            review: 'This class gives a good introduction to the theory and practice behind Kalman filters, Particle filters, PID control, A* search, and Graph SLAM. Proficiency in Python is VERY helpful if you want to get through assignments on time. As other reviews have touched on, Dr. Summet really does put a ton of effort into this class: he promptly answers questions with respect and clarity and is very helpful in office hours. As an added bonus, you have the opportunity to hear from Sebastian Thrun himself!\nYou are given the option to pursue a hardware assignment for extra credit, but the payoff is much less than the amount of work required so I did not pursue it. The lecture content is a bit simplistic, but the rigor of the projects and the inevitable outside research more than make up for that. Speaking of assignments, I implore you to start as soon as possible on the projects. You will spend the vast majority of your time tuning parameters, as you are learning how to make each algorithm robust to uncertain conditions.\nI think the ideal person for this class is someone who already understands Python at a decent level, who is interested in the fundamentals of autonomous systems, and who prefers project-based work as opposed to writing and theoretical deep dives. Getting an A is absolutely achievable if you do the work. This was my first class in the program and I have had no problems keeping up between work and my outside passions.',

Transitioned from Software Test Engineer to more Software Development during this phase of taking this course, full time job. Know enough Python from previous courses to do well on projects. Courses taken so far were:\n\nIOS Spring2018\nSAD Summer2018\nSAT, SDP Fall2018\nCN, DVA, DB Spring2019\n\nSummary\nGreat class. Loved all the projects and concepts. Some concepts were a bit harder to understand and wished they would go into a bit more depth and detail or answer your questions a bit more thoroughly on piazza. I heard summer semester is a bit more condense with the 5 projects (or even one less project during summer?).\nPros\n\nHomework was all Python, well guided\nLectures awesome, they break it down hard concepts into small parts that makes it much easier to understand\nGreat practice with DFS, BFS, search, path finding problems, that greatly benefit interview practice (Leetcode)\nCan test your code and know your exact score through Bonnie submission\n\nCons\n\nSome students are just so far ahead and they post/ask questions about a few projects ahead of you and can get confusing/annoying\nFew projects can be challenging and time consuming, but I'd rather do a fun challenging project than take an exam :)\nMay work on your local machine, but sometimes fail Bonnie tests.\n\nTips\n\nStart early. Read projects and know what you need to do. You just need to apply the lectures to do the project, so it helps to know what you're looking for in the project when doing the lectures.\n",

            review: "This was my first class. I expected this class to be a relative easy class based on the difficulty rating here. But I didn't expect it to be that easy. On weeks I actually work on it. I spent about 15 hours per week. But I finished everything a month before semester ended and got full score on every project. Overall I liked the class. I'd recommend this as a first class. The professor and TAs are very engaging on Piazza, and responded to questions very quickly. What i do not like about this class is that I feel Sebastian tries too hard to avoid math in those video lectures. I hoped he would do a little bit more explanation of the math behind. But I guess the expectation is that you would read the optional textbook, which is very mathematical, if you are interested in the math.",

There was project due every other weekend, plus you need to finish video watching and Quiz (required for credit) along the way. This will be an issue for some people in summer semester.\nInstructor provided time needed for completing the projects and encouraged front load the course. I usually spend the entire weekend right before the due date to complete the projects as by that time, usually all the issues found in the code based have been solved and other students put some ideas on piazza for you to reference. I felt this is a more cost effective way to do the projects for by looking at other's thoughts before starting to avoid wasting too much time. But some other people may prefer a different experience.\nInstructor (Jay) usually provide very specific suggestion for implementation, this can be good or bad depending on your stand point. But overall I loved this course as a starting point into robotics or AD  world - using math and code to solve real world problem is always exciting.\nBtw, book is optional and I didn't even look at it for more than 5 pages, so it is really optional.",

Unfortunately, as a summer course the course load is the same as a non-summer course (the summer course used to have one less project, no longer the case in summer 2019). As far as course  material goes, it's fairly easy but the projects require a lot of parameter tuning which  could be time consuming. Overall, it's a good course.

            review: "Took this course during summer 2019 - there is NO reduction of workload compared to normal semesters. So, please keep this in mind if you have vacations/other commitments planned. But, the course is fully front-loadable.\nChanges in the course: They have completely reworked 2 (first 2) of the 5 projects you have to do in this course.\nOverall, I think they have made the projects a bit more challenging (from what I heard from ppl who've taken this course before). But don't expect to learn lots of new concepts if you have already taken courses like CV as there are a few overlapping concepts (kalman filters, particle filters) which are (in my opinion) taught in a MUCH BETTER way in CV.  There is still no content about deep learning/ML or about any of the latest tech used in current self-driving car research.\nAbout the projects - except for project 2, they were all easy as the problem sets in the lectures give you a good idea of how to start approaching the project. The biggest timesink for me (and also pretty much anyone who started early) was project 2. I, along with many other students spent nearly 2 weeks and we were still not able to properly pass the test cases. This was absurd and very flustrating. The only approach that worked was that of the instructor's after he wrote about it in a piazza post. This project was so badly designed that they had to entirely change the test cases twice and also the grading scheme so that students would get full points even if they didn't pass all test cases. I hope they fix this project so that students in the future semesters don't have to mindlessly waste time on a single project without any useful learning outcome.\nI would not recommend this course if you are here to learn about the latest self-driving/autonomous car tech. This might be a good beginner course, - probably like a lighter AI course with a focus on pathfinding/localization etc., but if you have already taken few AI/ML related courses in OMSCS, you can skip this.\nThings that I did like:\n-Office hrs with Dr. Thurn where he answered student questions - it was really interesting to hear his answers!\n-Hands down, the most active instructor I've seen on piazza. Dr. Summet's activity in answers questions is what saved most students from dropping the course in my opinion (especially with the 2 new projects). The TAs were fine, but definitely not as active or useful as the instructor himself in answering student's questions.",

            review: "I agree with most of the other reviewers' comments - the biggest issue was that there was a bit of a gap between the lecture material and the projects. There was a little outside research needed to really solidify the concepts for me.\nPros:\n\n\nDr Summet is the most engaged professor in the program, bar none. He literally personally answers just about every single question on Piazza, no matter how trivial or if it's been repeated several times over.\n\n\nFor summer term, the entire set of syllabus, projects, and assignments were released on the first day of class. Some students finished the entire class within 4-5 weeks and spent the rest of the term presumably in a place with very agreeable climate and recreational options.\n\n\nThere's some element of chance in the projects due to the random seeding in the codebase. However, at least in the summer term, the grades were determined via Bonnie submissions. So you can work to \"tune\" your submissions to that in order to maximize your scoring.\n\n\nThe concepts in this class are relatively easy to grasp, and serves as a good intro class for both the OMSCS and presumably AI (which I have not taken). There were a good number of AI alums in the class and there seems to be a good bit of overlap.\n\n\nCons:\n\n\nThe projects were just not that exciting. They're essentially a minor variation on the lecture material codebase, and the work that needs to be done on top of it is >90% Python wankery for the most part and has little to do with the actual concept at hand.\n\n\nI know there's extra credit available via an independent hardware project. But given it's more $$$, it's not that enticing of an option for many.\n\n\nThe lecture videos are OK, but it seems every other quiz has an important errata to be mindful for which can be distracting.\n\n\nThe only thing to be concerned about is that this class can deceptively suck up a lot of time. It's not uncommon to hear people spending over 40-60 hours on a single project. Procrastinate at your peril.",

The professor had to change the grading scheme because it was too hard to pass all test cases.  I think there was probably some very brittle random seed logic going on.\nOther than mars glider everything else was very reasonable and fun to do.\nAll the projects were very well tied into the course material and I certainly feel I learned a great introduction into AI for Robotics!\nTLDR:  Good course\nNotes to future students -- the code-base is academic, don't get hung up on it!  It's basically a lot of bad code if you are seriously looking at it, but it works well enough to learn the concepts being taught, so I would just focus on that.\nThat being said, you can port a good amount of stuff into numpy if you really want, it just takes more time and I'm not sure it's worth it.",

Expect to do some self learning with YouTube, papers, or PB book. You can front-load the class over the summer as projects are released early.\nThe projects are pretty challenging and time consuming (20-40 hours) depending on how well you understand test cases and how much tuning is involved. Projects are an order of magnitude harder then the problem sets (which you get solutions for) and lectures (except for PID). I wouldn't call it an easy class and I think the projects are fair, interesting, and do test your knowledge of each idea. However, the sheer volume of things to master is far less than ML, RL, or CV, there are no tests, and you can breeze through the lectures quickly.\nThe TAs and Dr. Summet are really excellent and the course is well run.

The concepts in the lectures were simple, more undergrad level than graduate level in terms of their complexity, but they're powerful nonetheless. I watched a lecture one night then applied those concepts at my job the next day to good effect.\nThe projects can be time vampires for the wrong reasons. My advice is to be meticulous about understanding what is asked of you before writing a single line of code. Also be prepared to sink a lot of time into parameter tuning. Also I actually don't advise starting early so that bugs in the autograder/project code get fixed by the instructors before you invest any time.\nI think this was a good first for a couple reasons. Firstly it reminded me how to switch my brain from industry mode (objectives are clear but the problem scope is infinite) into academic mode (objectives are poorly communicated but project scope is very limited). Secondly since it's very frustrating how loosely the class is managed, I feel like this is a good litmus test for if you think the BS surrounding an online degree is worth it (I do).\nAgain, you get out of it what you put into it.

I don't have an academic CS background, and I had only so much exposure to Python. Yet I ended up getting a 94% without doing the extra credits. Here's a list of random things I'd like to mention:\n\nI spent a lot of time debugging my code. I didn't realize until after the first project that I should stop writing print statement for every variable, and rather use the debugger tools that come with any IDE. It saved me a ton of time once I started using it.\nI recommend this as a first course. It's gentle enough that it gives you flexibility to fill in your knowledge holes, whether it's math, Python, Linear Algebra, or in my case, debugging. But, It's also rigorous enough that you have to fill the holes on the fly, because you have to focus on implementing the Kalman Filter, for example.\nInvest some time doing the problem sets and the last quiz of each lecture, because they may be a good foundation on which you build your project.\nWorking ahead is good, but remember, the instructor reveals \"secrets\" as the project progresses that magically solve all your problems. For the second project, I was stuck for hours, until he mentioned the magic of \"Q matrix.\"\nOverall, Piazza is helpful. Slack is not. Though, I learned some cutting edge humble bragging techniques from folks there.\nLove Bonnie. Befriend it. Use it. Worry (almost) no more about your grade.\n",

            review: "This has been my second class in the program after CP, and I'm glad it wasn't the first one as I originally intended, otherwise I could have considered withdrawing and not coming back to OMSCS. Don't get me wrong, this is not a bad course, actually, the projects are very well organized and you will learn a lot working with them, however, the video lectures and the homework assignments have a so cheap MOOC taste, that ruins the general experience.\nThe lectures are quite decoupled from the project, full of absurd mini-quizzes and bugs solved in footnotes and comments. The homework assignments are based on these lectures. It is recommended to try to solve them by your own, and in case of getting blocked, watching the solution videos, however, you will probably end up just watching the solution, since the amount of bugs makes difficult to learn anything from them. I wouldn't care much about this in the first year of OMSCS, but it doesn't look serious for a top program that they haven't solved these issues after more than 5 years running.\nPutting these \"technical issues\" aside, as I said the project are the real meat of the course. They were:\n\nMini Project 1 - Kalman Filters: don't underestimate the \"mini\" part and start as early as possible, by far the most difficult and tricky of all of them.\nProject 1 - Kalman or Particle Filters: It was basically another twist to the previous Mini Project.\nMini Project 2 - PID: the lectures regarding this topic were just horrible, I'm glad I knew what was a PID before getting there.\nProject 2: Search\nProject 3: SLAM\n\nMP1 and P1 were by far my favourites. The way they are presented makes necessary to dive into books, papers and other resources. I suffered a lot with them, but I think they were the ones where I learnt the most. The MP2 one was quite simple compared to the first ones and its background interesting, definitely a better way to learn about PIDs than the lectures. Regarding the last two projects (P2, P3), they account for almost half of the score, but I had the feeling that they could be solved simply using part of the homework as a black box without a deeper understanding on it as it was required for the first projects.\nAfter all, I got a solid A, but didn't enjoy so much the semester. Anyway, I would recommend the class to anybody interested in getting the basics about mobile robotics, simply, take it easy in the videos and homework.",

Put in the hours and you will be fine.\nI'm kind of split regarding this course: while the topics covered are interesting and the video lectures are pretty good in the sense they give a nice intuitive grasp of the subjects, it seems like this was not built as a graduate level course but rather as a MOOC course with some projects added as an after-thought.\nThe course has 3 projects, 2 mini projects and the video assignments for each lecture (6 in total) and while in principal the projects could have been pretty fun to do, in practice most of time is wasted on tweaking parameters in order get your code to pass different test cases (the plus side - passing all provided test cases pretty much ensures you'll get a good grade) which is kind of boring. Overall - Ok, could be better with more in depth coverage of the material and better designed projects.",

            review: 'This is an excellent class. You will go over quite difficult topics and be required to code relatively open ended projects. The projects are a serious time commitment but manageable if you respect them. They are entirely in python. So it is a good chance to sharpen python skills if that is needed. The lectures do a good job of breaking complicated projects into understandable bits. They are a bit math heavy and utilize a good deal of linear algebra. The projects are all oop. So it is good to brush up on both those topics. An auto-grader is available that tells you your grade as you work on the project which reduces some of the stress of working on them.\nFor all the good feedback on this course, I will say it was extremely difficult. I put in over 40 hours a few weeks on the final project and got a B in the class still. That being said I still highly recommend',

            review: "I took this with Computational Photography, this was by far the easier class to manage. I finished everything two weeks before the deadline, as it stands, this is a good class to pair with another medium difficulty class, I could see someone getting blown up pairing it with something harder though.\nDescription:\n6 Problem Sets, can be done immediately after watching lectures. With lectures, expect a 1-5 hour time commitment. Recommendation: Front load the first 3-4 in the first week and kick of RR.\nMinProject 1: Runaway Robot, it's on Udacity, so you can see it. Tricky, multiple approaches available for use (Kalman Filter, Extended Kalman Filter, Particle Filter). There's a reason it's tricky if you pay enough attention to when things go wrong, you can find and fix it, do some extra reading to find the general fix, or take another approach. Recommend budgeting about 40 hours.\nProject 1: Polygon Robot. Primarily about the Particle Filter, some mutterings on Piazza about directly reusing RR code with high success. Easier than RR, but similar time commitment. This project may be getting scrapped for something new.\nMiniProject 2: PID. Maybe 5-6 hours total if you're smart. Test code provided is the same thing on Bonnie. This might be where the parameter twiddling complaints came from. IMO those complaints are pretty BS, good code solves problems without needing massive tweaking. Also, part of this project suggests using Twiddle, I easily outsource parameter tuning that direction. The testing visuals they have are great, which is probably why they've kept this, someone who gave a shit made them.\nProject 2: Warehouse. A*/Djikstra focused. Interesting, switches environment between A. discrete and B. continuous. Thought it was interesting, I over-engineered a solution and have a greater appreciation for the complexity of getting a best path in a continuous environment. One can make very basic adjustments and probably still get full credit. Maybe 30-40 hours.\nProject 3: Ice Robot. Pretty simple application of SLAM code from Problem Set. Thought it was a bit meh as far as difficulty and concept, maybe 20 hours. Finished 2 weeks before due date.",

The projects are a lot harder than you think on first read-through and can easily eat up a lot of time just trying figuring out how the TAs have structured their test environment.\nThe lecture material is easy to digest and gives you a really high-level overview. To actually do the assignments often requires quite a bit more research. Good introduction to Kalman/Particle Filters but the topics on PID and SLAM are really rushed and not very useful in actual applications.\nFor the PID project you were able to write a controller that could instantaneously adjust throttle which made it very easy to tune to get a 100% and very difficult to imagine how I would apply the tuning algorithm to a real situation.\nOverall, pretty neutral.',

You can work ahead on the lectures/quizzes and the projects to a point -- they are based on the Udacity concepts, so if you do the quizzes and programming assignments you should have a somewhat solid start to the projects.\nI know I made it harder than it needed to be because I investigated the various filters and put effort into architecting a lot of the Python for reuse.  Some parts are twiddly and a little tedious.  But the overview and the concepts Dr. Thrun goes over are solid.  You should be comfortable with algebra (dimensionality/linear algebra and coordinate conversion), probability (basic/intermediate), and python (2.7 this semester).  We did have access to numpy though.\nI\'d like to see a little more advanced stuff in this course as far as integrating all the pieces into a system, or maybe cooperatively working with a Computer Vision or Machine Learning framework (for sensors or the like).  There was a rumor that a previous project had been temporarily sidelined my semester which did include a more integrated solution.  Our projects primarily amounted to what I would call "primary subsystems" -- localization, navigation, obstacles and planning,...\nOne more thing, having had zero robotics before this course, I still found the topics very approachable and the explanations were very grounded and practical.',

It consists of 2 mini projects and 3 larger projects. The course covers Kalman filters, particle filters, PID control, A* planning, and the SLAM algorithm. The projects can be solved via any technique that gets the job done and several students used geometry solution techniques early on and good heuristic approaches later on. The course started using Bonnie this semester and it was nice knowing what your likely grade would be. Though the professor reserved the right to re-run your code against other test cases as he saw fit.\nThere are also 6 problem sets that need to be submitted. It is well known that the solutions for these problem sets are provided in the lectures themselves, but it is best to really try to solve each problem set since it will help you have a good understanding of the topic before attempting the corresponding project. A lot of the problems in the problem sets are small to medium programming assignments and are harder to accomplish than you might imagine. Overall, I mostly enjoyed this course, but I didn't really like problem set 6 which is for the SLAM algorithm. The corresponding lecture was too hand wavy to understand it and they really should revamp this lecture. I ended up reading about SLAM in the class text and implemented the EKF algorithm found there to solve the SLAM project.",

            review: 'Introduction\nThis is my fifth course in OMSCS and have previously completed ML4T, SDP, IIS and CP. I have good enough programming background and comfortable with writing non trivial code. All assignments are in Python and assignments are usually released with two weeks to work. I would rate the workload slightly lower than Computational Photography and equivalent to ML4T.\nProblem Sets\nThere are six problem sets which are evaluated in Udacity itself. The TAs require the students to answer in Udacity and upload the answers in Canvas as well. This constitutes 25% of the grade and the answers are there in Udacity videos itself. You can review the videos and ensure that the last submission is the correct one. The Canvas upload is used only as a backup if Udacity results are unavailable.\nMini Projects\nThere are two mini projects and Runaway Robot was the first one. This follows close to the video lectures and brushing up on trigonometry and motion models should make this simple enough to finish. (spent time: 3 hrs)\nThe second mini project PID Controller was even more a simpler one and following the videos closely could get the code completed easy (spent time: 2 hrs)\nMini project test suites are provided along with the template code and getting the test cases to pass is sufficient.\nMini-Projects and Project 1 constitute 30% of the grade.\nProjects\nThere are three projects:\n\nProject 1 - Polygon robot [Time spent: 15 hours]\nProject 2 - Robot in a warehouse [Time spent: 30 hours]\nProject 3 - Rover robot on ice [Time spent: 45 hours]\n\nThese are non trivial projects which increase in terms of complexity and also builds off each other. The test suite provided is not complete with more rigorous hidden test cases which made me lose the Project 1 scores to only 75%. It is important to test the shared tests by other students and share your edge cases as well in Piazza. The TAs usually released the projects early by atleast a week, sometimes even 10 days giving ample amount of time to complete them.\nExtra Credit\nThere was an extra credit of 2% for exceptional H/W systems being built out of their own interest. This would help if you are on the verge of a letter grade upgrade. For example 89% with extra credit would give you an \'A\'\nLectures and Relevance\nThe lectures were fun and Dr. Thrun does a fantastic job of making the videos engaging and working throw the topics. The only problem is that they are clearly too basic to prepare the students for the projects themselves. The videos are great for getting a fundamental understanding. However the transference to the project code is not trivial.\nGood to learn\nBrushing up on geometric models, basic motion structures would help work on the projects better.\nMaterial\nThough the book "Probabilistic Robotics" is a good read, it was not really required for this course and all the grading is based only on assignments and there are no exams.',

            review: 'This was my third course in the program and it was an interesting survey of techniques used in robotics. The course covers robot localization with Kalman filters and particle filters, motion planning search algorithms like A*, PID control, and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms. This is very much an engineering course so make sure to brush up on your probability, linear algebra, trigonometry and python. The course is all projects  so depending on how diligent you are you may find yourself doing next to nothing some weeks and working 30 hours another week to finish a project. I recommend this course for a first semester student. I do wish we went a little more in depth into the details and proofs of some of the algorithms but given the wide range of material covered it may have been impractical.',

            review: "=========================My Background ===================\nHave been working for 2 years as a Software Engineer with Python as my main language. This was my first course\n======================= General Summary ===================\nThe course is a great first course for OMSCS. The content is certainly wide but not deep. Prof. Thrun does a great job of explaining the mathematical aspects of the content in a very intuitive way. However, the actual mathematics is not delved into deeply. Diving deep into the mathematical derivations is not necessary to get good grades, but if you do decide to do that, the course (which is otherwise moderate) becomes very difficult.\n=========================Pros ============================\nYou get a good idea about how Bayes Theorem works in localization problems. In my opinion, the best part of the course was mini-projects and projects. I have found a new appreciation for the practical aspects of Robotics. Who knew noise control could be so tough!\nYou will learn a good deal about a variety of topics - from localization, to control, to search, and finally to SLAM.\nThis semester (Fall'18), the course was conducted very well. I think this was the first time a project on SLAM was introduced.  Sr. Lecturer Jay Summet was always present on Piazza to clear our doubts and help us in all possible ways. The TAs were responsive. Projects were timely graded and the overall experience was very positive.\n========================Cons===============================\nDo take the course if you want to know how self-driving cars are working. If you do not have much interest in the area, you might not enjoy the course much. The content lacks mathematical depth which I think is fair, but would be nice to touch upon.",

            review: 'AI4R was my first course in the program, my first college course in decades, and my first course in the Computer Science field (I\'m an electrical engineer by education & career). Although I liked the class, I decided to withdraw in late Oct when it became clear I was unlikely to get a final grade of "B."\nFor non-traditional students like myself with a steeper Computer Science / python learning curve, I recommend finding the "easiest" two classes to start with, regardless of specialization area, to improve the chances that you will successfully complete two foundational classes with a B or better in your first 12 months.\nProfessor Summet & his TAs were helpful and engaged in trying to help students over the humps. My main complaint in this course was that .. even after projects were graded, they still would not share code solutions. I got a 50% on one of the early projects (which was fair because I did not grok how-to translate the approach into working code at the time). However, even after getting that poor final project grade, they still would not share code solutions. It seems to me there should be a middle-road to show students what they did wrong without resulting in professors having to develop new projects from scratch every ~four months.\nLastly, I\'d like to share the office hour links .. Dr Thrun\'s comments are all excellent, but in particular his remarks on the relevance of some portions of this current AI4R course really should be reviewed by students considering this class in the future. He makes great recommendations for additional (or even alternative) educational opportunities in the autonomous vehicle arena.\nOffice Hour Week 15\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2v77_zTQtE\nDr. Sebastian Thrun Office Hour\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82zUf32flMs\nOffice Hour Week 14\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaIGjD4HY8M\nOffice Hour Week 13\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-rjspBWoRI\nOffice Hour Week 12\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aXtJTqwyvI\nDr. Sebastian Thrun Office Hour\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMkLwYe1GZ8\nOffice Hour Week 10\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gK0XX2kjHAc\nDr. Sebastian Thrun Office Hour\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KRHwFGE_xY\nOffice Hour Week 8\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6J7dk2TApw\nOffice Hour: Wek 7\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1YTxpeVYZpU\nOffice Hour: Week 6\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EqofDEngA0\nOffice Hour: Week 5\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xtc7XFUCo7M\nOffice Hour: Week 4\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNrumNzuADg\nOffice Hour: Week 3\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPeXOFeyOG8\nOffice Hour: Week 2\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hK7zHYxJQK4',

            review: "AI4R was a great introduction to fundamental concepts of robotics; localization, Kalman and Particle Filters, PID control, A* and various search algorithms, and finally SLAM.  All topics are taught around the concept of a self-drivng vehicle.  The projects are the highlight of the course and main source of learning.  The projects are very well constructed, challenging, and quickly reviewed.\nPython is the language de jour in AI4R.   I tried to use NumPy as much as possible while not required.  I would not take this course without some Python background although its an easy language to pick up.  It would be nice if the projects were designed for C++ given that is the predominant language in the industry.\nThe instructor, Dr Jay Summet, was very active on Piazza as were the TA's.  The course is well organized and coordinated.  Dr Sebastian Thrun, who originally developed the material for the course, does some offices hours which is neat, but not directly useful for the courses.  He is a good lecturer but I don't like how many quizes are built into the Udacity lectures.\nAdvice for the course, work ahead on the lessons, allocate 40+ hours for each project, and take advantage of the hardware challenges, as much as you have time.\nI highly recommend this course for anyone with a mild interest in robotics.",

            review: "This was my first OMSCS course, and it worked out well. The lectures are all available on Udacity, and the course more or less follows the pacing  of the course there. The material was produced by Sebastian Thrun, who narrates the videos. Thought he was awesome, given his on-the-ground expertise in the field. Dr Thrun did office hours several times, which was \"really, really great\" (as he likes to say). The instructor for the course -- Dr Jay Summet -- was great as were the TA's. Both were super responsive. The forums were super helpful as was the Slack channel.\nIn terms of the material itself, it's really AI-lite in as much as the focus is on entry-level algorithms used in self-driving vehicles -- actual AI/ML is outside the scope of this course. I feel like I learned quite a number of really interesting algorithms -- Kalman filters, Particles filters, A star, Theta star, PID, SLAM. The assignments were all fairly straight forward, except the very first one -- Runaway Robot -- which I found very challenging. I would suggest getting through the first few sections of the course straight away, and start work on Runaway immediately.\nSo you can assess my review appropriately, I have 15+ years of software engineering experience across the stack. I am super comfortable with learning new frameworks/languages, and researching things I don't understand. I have a partial CS undergraduate degree.",

This course has some times where you may not have much work to do, and other weeks where you can spend 30-40 hours trying to do a project. The lectures themselves are very very dry and Sebastian Thrun (the main instructor) does a terrible job of relaying material and concepts beyond the first lecture. The projects can be very confusing on what needs to be done, and expect to spend lots of time debugging the issues. I want a disclaimer that I got a high A in this course, so I am not just some disgruntled student  but I was very unhappy with the execution. If I had to say one positive thing about this course, the TA's were pretty quick and helpful.",

            review: "AI4R was a great class! It was a suitable option for summer session, as the third project, which is definitely a difficult and time consuming one, was dropped. There were opportunities for extra credit as well, which was great if you were wanting to ensure you don't just miss out on a grade by a percent or two.\nThe lectures are well done, but you will have to do a lot of extra reading to supplement the videos. It's not too bad, but I can understand if people are put off by this fact, especially if they're not expecting it. The videos do a good job of covering the foundations and touch on some of the more advanced details, but you will likely have to read some papers or other resources to get a handle on more advanced techniques and implementation of these techniques.\nThe projects are fairly well defined; we had two mini-projects, and two full projects. The full projects were definitely time consuming, so I would suggest starting on them soon after release. Even if it's just playing around with different ideas and trying different approaches, it will help you get a handle on how the problems are set up and how you should be tackling them. The nice thing about the projects is that they're fairly open-ended in terms of implementation, as you can choose from a few viable algorithms or approaches to solve the problems.\nAssignments are your answers to the quizzes in the Udacity videos. You also have to upload your code and answers to ensure nothing gets lost in case Udacity loses your answers on their end. These were easy and basically a free 30%.\nTAs were excellent; they were extremely responsive and informative. Assignment and project grades were given back VERY fast, sometimes in the same day.\nAll-in-all, it was a well-run class and I would highly recommend. If you want to learn SLAM, which is an important and very powerful algorithm for robot localization and mapping, to the fullest extent the class can offer, I would advise taking this during the regular term so you don't miss out on project 3. Be warned that it IS very difficult, however. So if you don't mind missing out on this last project, this class is a decent choice for summer. Though it's probably still not the easiest, it's enjoyable and very much doable.",

            review: "I enjoyed this class, overall. It wasn't super difficult, but the projects were sufficiently challenging and engaging. The runaway robot project can be tough without prior experience with Kalman/particle filters (it helps having already taken CV, since one of the projects in there uses these filters). And the final project (project 2 for the summer course) was definitely a big challenge - one that combined most of the topics learned in the class - but was extremely rewarding at the end.\nI wish the course also included the SLAM project and more content from that area, but I understand the difficulty in cramming more material in a shorter window. I feel like the course could be reworked to include this if certain aspects of the prior projects were modified.\nEither way, I'd recommend taking this course if you're interested in robotics and automation. It's not insanely in-depth, but the projects are engaging, and the topics are interesting.\nAlso, I think this often gets recommended as a potential first course. I actually would not recommend taking this first, unless you are very confident in your Python/Numpy/linear algebra skills. I think getting some more experience in those areas goes a long way with the projects in this class.",

The class seems to be designed from the ground up to scale for being online, and it makes a huge difference.\nI agree with other reviews that this course comes more from an engineering perspective than a science perspective. Principles are taught in class and they are useful in the projects, but the projects will throw some real-world curveballs at you, so you need to do some real-world problem solving, and find some workable heuristics to use with the principles. And if you find a 'cheap' solution that doesn't even use the class material, that's okay - the rule here is if it works, it's not stupid! That's a delightful approach; without it, students sometimes end up having to play \"guess what the instruct is expecting you to think\".",

            review: "This is by far the worst course I have ever taken, including other MOOCs and in-person courses.\nWhen I took the class there were three projects - runaway robot, warehouse robot, and predicting the location of a hexbug. The hexbug project was a group project and meant to be the hardest, however, you can use scikit learn to basically do it for you so it ends up being trivial. The warehouse robot project involved having a robot navigate a maze to locate packages. However, the robot is allowed to walk through walls so there is really no maze that needs to be navigated. Releasing a project in this state to students would never have happened at my previous college. The runaway robot project is fun, but the later parts are unconnected to the lectures.\nBy far the most annoying thing about this course is the number of errata in the materials. Too many lectures have written notes correcting the material covered in the video. Too many homework problems give you code to work on that is incorrect. Fixing this would markedly improve the learning experience, I don't understand why a college with the resources of GT doesn't do this.\nThis course is what made me go from recommending the OMSCS to my co-workers, to actively telling them to avoid it.",

I must have spent 100 hours on it trying different ways to solve it. Settled down on particle filter and it's smooth sailing from there. SLAM was very interesting and challenging. Btw, don't expect to use simple geometry algorithms and get an A.\nOverall a great class, the student interactions made it much more enjoyable. I got a ton of help and helped a ton of people. This is how I hope all other classes would be.",

It reduced workload but it would have been better to have learnt it. There were no tests nor group projects nor papers to write. 2 projects and 1 mini project had to be implemented in python. Got an A- just managed to scrape through. Professor Jay Summet is excellent and so are the TAs. Slack and Piazza are life savers.\nI had fun learning!',

            review: "This is an engineer's course where you understand the concepts and code it. There is some Math involved like conditional probability, Basic Geometry and linear algebra, Bayesian theory, Matrix Math and so on. A self driving car is extremely complex and you are learning from a self driving car pioneer Dr. Thrun which is very good. However you only learn the basics in this course and would barely scratch the surface. Having said that this course covers pretty much the heart of what is needed like Localization using Kalman filter and Particle filter, different search techniques like A*, PID control and SLAM. I found SLAM the toughest to understand and comprehend. This course has no reports or writing which is the best part. Its pure coding and the projects are all or nothing. It starts out pretty simple with the Runaway Robot and gets progressively harder as the course progresses. Project 3 : SLAM Warehouse is the toughest of all and unfortunately for the summer course this was excluded for obvious reasons. But I was glad I got to do the SLAM Problem set 6 which itself was challenging despite being an introduction to SLAM. A piece of advise is to start early on the projects and assignments as they are released very early. If you time and plan all the projects and assignments early enough, you will have a month for the final project3 and trust me, you would need all the time in the world for that. The drop deadline is pretty much useless for this course unless you screw up the earlier projects which is unlikely. The TAs for this course were the best I have encountered so far. Prof. Summet is very active on Piazza and super helpful. The office hours are recorded so there is little reason to watch it live. Being active on Piazza and the Slack channel is the key as you gain immensely from fellow students insights and advise. Overall an excellent course and the experience was very satisfying.",

I DO NOT recommend this as your first course if you have been away from school for some time, like me (17 years). I loved the topic, the TAs and Instructor were rock stars. The final 2 projects made me lose my mind. I worked 100+ hours on each one and got very low scores, after getting 100% on all previous assignments. It was extremely stressful. So be prepared for a fairly unbalanced course by working far ahead so you can devote 100% of the last 6-8 weeks on Projects 2 and 3. It will be easier if you understand A* path planning ahead of time. Know Python more than the basics as well. Projects change slightly each semester. No team projects. No exams.',

Finally, TAs extended the deadline by a week and gave us some breathing space. We were able to manage some partial credit on the last project and a lot of students fell back in their grades. The course is really interesting and has lots of stuff to learn and enjoy. But the projects demand heavy efforts, time and energy. There is not much of guidance from TAs and usually limited to high level ideas only. It will boil down to keep trying to find the best algorithm around the ideas to pass the testcases.",

I don\'t have formal CS educational background or software engineering working experience. I have been programming with Python for a year or so to prepare for the application of OMSCS. I have taken college maths classes (which I dont think is used in this course).\nAbout the class materials: The lectures are very interesting and well structured. Probably not wide/deep enough. But the research challenge arranged by the instructor provided good opportunities for self-exploration and learning from each other. It is a pity that I did not spend much time on it. The hardware challenge also seems very interesting. I am not a hardware person myself but the things classmates posts are really impressive.\nAbout the instructor: The instructor Jay is very nice and effective. He almost answered/hinted every question on piazza. In a few cases when I twisted my wording to hide my stupidity when asking questions, he seemed to understand my intention and hinted on my confusion directly. I really appreciate his efforts in running this class well.\nAbout the projects: Project 3 is challenging. There are too many details that can mess things up. I decided to give it up to get a B but the deadline was extended.  So I "had to" work on it for another week and eventually I scored 6 out of 10 test cases and managed to get a A. (I lost 4 points because my solution was not designed to deal with certain situations due to lack of energy).\nMy lesson from project 3 is\n\n\nyou need to really understand what SLAM is doing exactly in each step (same for the other algorithms taught in the class) . Only after that you can correctly modify the implementation. It seems a lot of classmates claimed that there is bug in the SLAM code. But it did work, at least for some other classmates and me.\n\n\nread and participate in the discussions on piazza. I had to make numerous decisions for the project and I did not have the time/patient to try them out. For learning purposes I listed the pros and cons for my options but most of my decisions are based on the comments from the instructors and other classmates. Sometimes even \'typing\' the question helped me figure out the answer immediately. I heard from the instructor that it is called "Rubberduck debugging".\n\n\nFirst class?\nIf you know python and know how to plan to "solve a problem" and execute your plan, I think you should be fine. For me, most of the difficulties of Project 3 in the first two weeks came from my messed up code and code structure, which made it very difficult to debug.',

            review: "I took this course along with DVA for my first semester. I liked DVA, but I thought this course was much better - I loved it.\nPositives:\nDr Thrun's lectures are fascinating, and he has boundless enthusiasm for the subject. That enthusiasm didn't just come through in the lectures, but in the three office hours he gave throughout the semester. These office hours were interesting too, and he took questions from students ranging from project implementation details to research and industry topics. Pretty cool.\nDr Summet's office hours were very useful, and he held them every week. He was also very involved on Piazza and personally answered many student questions.\nThe projects are fun. The course doesn't cover that many topics, but you will become an expert in A*/DP path planning, Kalman/Particle filters, and PID control. When/if you finish the projects, you'll feel proud. And if you're like me,  you'll replay the Python scripts over and over once you're done just to watch what you made.\nIn my semester, the students on Piazza were valuable and supportive.\nThere were no tests, and the homework answers were given for free (they still counted towards your grade). No group projects. You'll have many weeks to prepare for most of the projects.\nNegatives\nThe projects really seem all-or-nothing. They use an automated grader to score your projects, and you'll probably have to spend double digit hours just to maybe get a tiny amount of points from the sample grader. The real test cases they will grade with are not given in advance, but sample cases are provided that closely match. Don't underestimate the time commitment you'll need for those projects. We had a week extension on the last project, and still many people reported that they could not get any points on their test runs before having to turn it in.\nTips\nPython is heavily used, and it will be valuable if you're already familiar with it. Start the projects right when they become available. Try to do the projects in stages, like making sure you have basic functionality before meeting the full requirements.\nI wouldn't go so far to say that the lectures didn't cover what you need for the projects (like others have stated). The core of my logic for every project was solely stuff we learned in class. That being said, there are implementation details that will take a while to work out, and parameters that will need to be heavily tuned. You'll have to get creative.",

            review: "Was already familiar with many of the algorithms that were covered in lecture. Later strategies were interesting. The projects are a whole other beast as they test much more than what is covered in lecture. Compared to other courses such as Computational Photography or Computer Vision I would say the projects are 'easier' conceptually but 'significantly less straightforward' to implement.\nEg a project which was basically 'implement particle filters' which I've implemented at least 3 times before took 10x as much time to finish as in other classes. This is due to a lack of scaffolding provided compared to other courses (you have to integrate your code and write almost everything that's not related to the core algorithm). I will say they did cover how to implement particle filters quite well. Just that the bulk of your time in the projects is not spent on the core algorithms the lectures cover.\nThe projects build on one another so if you didn't manage to get earlier projects be ready to devote significant time on later projects catching up. Lastly the grades are all or nothing (very much like real life) unlike other courses which test each part of the project separately.\nIf you are not familiar with the concepts taught in this class you will struggle with having enough time to implement them. That being said the lectures do cover the material quite well. It's just due to the all or nothing nature it'll be hard for you to know whether it is a bug with the algorithms or an integration bug somewhere else.\nSemi extra credit in terms of additional projects/challenges was offered, but I don't consider them realistic given the time devoted to core projects.\nI would NOT recommend this to new students to the program. For the final project around 1/3 of the students got 0% on the grade on a piazza poll and less than 1/2 got >50% due to the all or nothing nature.\n\nTip for project 3: Ignore almost everything that is suggested for this project by lecture. The biggest challenge is not related to what the project seems to want to test you on at all. If you waste your time on the algorithm covered in lecture. You won't have time to work on the actual time consuming part of the project. You won't even need anything you implemented in Project 2 or Project 1B. Just use the strategy from Project 1A to deal with inputs and focus on the real challenge. Learned this the hard way when I ran out of time and discovered my optimized implementation wasn't even needed or used in the final solution. Also for the mini project before hand, there's a significantly simpler alternative that's much easier than the suggested algorithm. Save your time for Project 2/3 instead of the miniproject.",

The advantage is that you can easily understand the concepts, but the disadvantage is also obvious that you don't understand where these concepts come from and you have no idea how to practice them when facing a complex problem. The homework are pretty easy and solutions are given to you so they give you a very good opportunity to practice your programming skills in python. Although you can get free 30% from the homework assignments, the projects are not so easy.  Project 2 and Project 3 each took me more than 600 lines of code. They are not easy, but not that hard. As others said, even if you cannot solve the problem with the concepts from the lectures, you can solve them using geometrically solutions. So, overall, how much you learn from the course is based on how much extra work you paid to this course. One bad side of this course is that you either receive 100% or 0% for project or homework, so a lot of students will receive above 95% for the overall score. So the cutoff for A will be most likely 90%.",

Workload was around 10-15 hrs per week initially but in the last 4 weeks it was over 30+ Hrs per week therefore I would advice that do not pair it with another difficult course. If you are planning to take two courses then this should be the "difficult" course and then other one should be "easier" of the two.\nI was able to get an A in the course and did fairly well but this course is a very hard course. Like others have mentioned the difficulty of the course has changed over time. The last "sensor-warehouse" assignment was apparently an extra credit assignment till last semester but from Fall 2017 has become compulsory assignment and is 20% of the course therefore if you do bad on it then it could affect your grades significantly even if you might have been scoring more than 90% up untill that assignment.\nThe TAs are super helpful and they encourage students to share their solutions and learn from each other. Almost all assignments can be solved in multiple ways both taught in the class and otherwise.\nFinally, having said all that I think this course is fantastic (but hard). Knowing what I already know I would do it again. I did this course with Intro to Information Security, but if I were to do it again I would do it as the only course as the learning outcome would be much higher.',

            review: "If you are interested in self-driving car technology, and who isn't, you want to take this course.  This was the perfect course.  It had a world renown professor, the head of google's self driving cars, who knows his stuff, explains complex topics in intuitive ways, is enthusiastic and has a sense of humor.  The TAs are great, on top of every thread.  And if you're into this sort of thing, it is E.A.S.Y.  The answers are given!   You can literally just cut and paste code from the answers page and put it in.  The TAs are ok with this.  The lectures are short, and there is no complex mathematics anywhere that you find in many other OMSCS courses (it's all simple trigonometry).  This is the best course ever, and the perfect introduction to OMSCS.  If you are just starting your masters, you want this course.\nMy only complaint is it was too easy.  Now, a lot of other reviews say it was hard, so hard they dropped out, and there was too much math.  Let me address this.  First, If they think there was too much math here, or it was hard, they obviously haven't taken a truly hard class, like Machine Learning, Graduate Algorithms, AI, Computer Vision, etc etc.  If they found this hard, I don't see how they would be able to graduate.  There is NO math required to get an A (again, you can just cut-and-paste answers).\nThe reason people think it is hard is because they shoot themselves in the foot.  They did not ask 'is there an easier way to do this?'.  They did not read the requirements carefully, or assumed too much.  For example, for the projects, you are asked to predict the next location of a robot.  The lectures are about Kalman filters, and so many people naturally assumed you should be using a Kalman Filter.  But see, that is not anywhere in the assignment.  Why even bother, when it's such a simple solution? The robot is moving a fixed distance at a fixed angle.  SImple trigonometry will give you the answer.  The next assignment, the measurements are noisy, and these people again, for whatever reason, shoot themselves in the foot and try to use a Kalman filter.  It's non-linear noisy movement, so they try to implement the Extended Kalman Filter.  Again, there is no need to do that!  The EKF isn't even mentioned!  There were posts after posts on the Extended Kalman Filter, pages and pages devoted to the topic, for absolutely no reason.   Why do unneccessary work like 'calculating the determinate of the Jacobian Matrix'?  I have no idea.\nThe only assignments you're not given the answers to are the 3 projects.  There are people reporting 100+ hours on the third project alone.  I handed it in within 3 days, and got a 100%.  These people are trying to do it the hard way, like calculate probabilities for distant objects, trying to implement difficult algorithms like graph slam, all for no reason.  Sure, all those things were suggested in the descriptions, and that's what the lectures are about, so kudos to you if you wanted to go that route.  But, and I can't emphasize this enough, there is no need for any of that.  There's no move limit, you can ram into as many walls as you like - that means you can design the most inefficent algorithm you want.  You can randomly carom your robot about the screen and, while slow and ugly, will eventually traverse the entire warehouse.  I can mathematically prove it if you want.\nPoint is, if you're willing to solve problems in your own way, and not the complicated way, you'll do just fine in this class.  I didn't even know python when starting this course and my final grade is 99.5%",

            review: "So, this is my honest review of the class. The class is not time consuming with the exception of the projects. There are six problems sets (if I don't recall incorrectly), and these are easy to complete because you have the solution available to you and a video that walks you through the code. For the projects, a mini project in addition to three main projects will be given. The projects are very time consuming.  In my opinion, this turns out to be this way because the lectures and material presented in class are effective in showing basic concepts for this class, but fail to expand more into each of those basic concepts to make such material meaningful to solving the projects. Don't get me wrong. Even with the right background, the projects would be hard and time consuming.\nGrading of these projects strictly depends on your code being able to pass test cases. If you don't pass any of the test cases, you don't get any marks. It doesn't matter if you have a 1000 line code. That being said, do well in the mini project, project 1 and 2. These projects are doable, and you can get them done in a week or less except for project 2. Spend more time on that one because part b of this project becomes challenging and is code that you can use for project 3. The deadline for dropping classes is right around the same time project 2 is given, so if you flunk project 2 you will not be able to drop the class. It would be better if you could complete project 2 before the drop deadline to be able to better gauge your success in the class. This is something future students should recommend. Project 3 is the hardest. Spend two weeks or more on it. The connection between project 3 and the class material is the least apparent, so you will spend more time figuring out how to proceed with your implementation. Chances are that you will reuse your code from project 2 part b.\nThe nice part is that project previews in Piazza usually come a week prior to the release of the projects in t-square. This allows you to work ahead, which helps with organization and project time allocation. So, as soon as you get the project preview, start working on the project.\nAs a summary, my recommendation is to 1) Do well in the mini project, project 1 and project 2 to be successful and 2) organize yourself to allocate enough time for each project, and 3) start working on the projects as soon as the project previews become available.",

Unfortunately, the video lecture series are short and honestly insufficient for the final 2 projects that determine your final grade. The final project is very difficult - start immediately when you receive it. With the limited materials provided by the course, you will need to conduct your own research and reading to discover a solution that works and this discovery process can take days to weeks. Do not underestimate this course, this is not an "easy A" anymore and will kick into high gear in the second half of the course; be prepared to work hard.',

I found Prof.  Summet to be very helpful and responsive on Piazza.  As others have said, the projects can take a long time.  The udacity assignments (problem sets + mini robot) should be 100% and that covers about 40% of grade.  Be very careful about falling behind on project 2 as you'll want to have a good implementation of it as project 3 is a very difficult extension of it.  I think all told I spent close to 100+ hours on projects 2/3 together.  I would highly recommend a TDD approach for these later projects because they can get pretty complicated and finding bugs once the system is fully built can be very difficult.  Most of the assignments and early projects culminate in the later ones so if you fall behind or have a bad project early plan to spend extra time on the later assignments.",

            review: "Interesting lectures. Like other reviewers I feel they don't go deep enough but I think Udacity lectures can/will only go so deep in general anyway. The optional textbook helps with that for this course.\nRequired for the summer were problem sets on Udacity (30%), project 1 (20%), project 2 (20%), final project (30%). There were numerous extra credit opportunities, both actual EC and pseudo EC that would push you to a higher grade if you were on the boundary.\nUdacity has all the answers for the problem sets and it was expected that we would use them before submitting. That's 30% of our grade just given to us.\nProject 1 was the runaway robot project on Udacity. Although it appears at the end of the Udacity course, only the first 3 lessons were relevant. Part 5 of the project ended up being extra credit. The first 4 parts are doable with basic math and probability, but the point is to use what was learned in those first 3 lessons.\nProject 2 involved helping a robot find its way around a warehouse. Contrary to what others say, the 3 parts of this project directly correspond to lessons 4, 5, and 6. Part A was a breeze. Part B was not but some really awesome students shared their own test cases on Piazza. Instructors used some when grading. They helped me find serious flaws in my code and my project 2 grade was better because of it. Thank you, awesome students. Anyone who didn't use those test cases only has themselves to blame. Part C had so many kinks it ended up becoming EC. Part B was regraded when it was discovered some test cases didn't match the project specs.\nFinal project, hexbug location prediction, sounds irrelevant to the material covered in class. It's not. It's certainly doable with irrelevant items but many successful projects used techniques (or extensions) from class. Using extensions of techniques learned in class is reasonable for a grad-level course in a top-tier school.\nTAs were great and helpful. Pryby as well, more so than others here suggest.",

            review: "In general, I agree with all the posts from my Summer 2017 cohorts. Great content, unbalanced projects requiring deeper dives outside of lecture materials--and time requirement exponentially growing in latter projects. Could have been way better managed--really wanted to love this class.\nGreat content, generous of Dr. Thrun for the two office hours, valiant attempt by a single TA running the class. Failed to impart any real understanding beyond the pre-packaged video content due to fear of releasing any real help (or content for future sessions) by openly discussing the problem both before or after the fact. Missed learning opportunity.\nAgain, the TA being overtly secretive about revealing approaches (not their fault) to the solutions produced the wrong kind of struggle for students. (Vastly different from ML4T, CP or CV--where you're guided to spend time focused on the right problems. ) And prevented forming a deep understanding of the mechanics of the concepts presented. Instead, this lead to time-wasting, misplaced effort and lots of wheel-spinning. The second downside was that once the project was completed, there were no real discussions about how each student approached and solved the problems—hence you’re left with whatever understanding you had without any affirmation or new insight as to the different approaches taken.\nThe lead instructor (not Thrun) was barely involved and didn’t seem to be in touch with the class other than to chastise the class for possible violation of the honor code. To be fair, the generous curve at the end provided some relief but overall, it was pretty stressful (in the wrong way).",

            review: 'The course starts out quite easy, probably 6 hours a week or so through the first project. Once the second project started things changed, probably 20-30 hours a week for the rest of the semester. The second project hadn\'t been assigned as mandatory before and it was not really ready to be released. There were a lot of issues with the descriptions and grading of that project. Hopefully it will be smoother in future semesters. The final project seemed impossible at first, but if you just experiment with things you have learned in this class (or other classes) you will find you can achieve decent results. So my two pieces of advice for the final project:\n\nWrite a good script to test with. This will really help with #2\nExperiment with different approaches. Just try things. Overall I implemented 5 approaches and fine-tuned the best of those five.\n\nLectures: Not many lectures, only 6 but they were of good educational quality though some of the in lecture quizzes had a bit of disconnect from the instructions given in the "intro" video for the quiz.\nHomework: You have a homework set for each Lecture. The answers are given during the lecture so you should be able to get a perfect score here. (30% of your grade)\nProjects: As noted above the first was pretty straightforward. The second was pretty hard and a bit of a mess for our semester at least. The final project can be done in groups if you want, that might help with my advice above about trying different approaches. I went solo and got a good score.

We also got two office hours with Dr. Thrun, which was awesome - he answered every single question, both times.\nBeyond this, the class is rather messy. It feels like they tried to take a short, free Udacity course and turn in into a full semester's worth of work by extending it with two projects that go beyond the scope of the lectures. Essentially, there's the 6-week Udacity portion (which is great), then with no further instruction there are two more projects (which are beyond the scope of the lectures - although they'll tell you otherwise). Of course, you can solve the last two projects with just the knowledge gained from the lectures, but it's very difficult to do so. You'll have to do more unguided research than you expect. Despite reviews from past semesters rating this course as an easy one, I urge you not to expect this course to be easy, because it's not (unless you're already familiar with the math and robotics).\nMy advice: if you need this class for your specialization (like me) then you'll just have to go for it, however if you don't need it, I wouldn't necessarily recommend it, at least not during a short summer semester. Hopefully in the near future (like ASAP) they'll fix this course.\nTo end on a more positive note, if you don't take this course, I highly recommended doing the Udacity portion on your own.

            review: "I would like to give this class a better rating because I really enjoyed the material and Dr. Thrun, and it fairly well organized in some ways. However there is a very significant gap between the lectures and projects and that causes real problems. I would say the lectures are at advanced high-school level, but you need a much better graduate level understanding of the material to be able to do the projects. You are going to need to spend a lot of time researching the topics on your own. Over the summer, this is a big problem. The lectures and homeworks don't require that much time - about 10 hrs/week when you have them (6 weeks of lectures) - but beware! The projects are very large. I carefully timed my workload and people are really lowballing it in their estimates. My average time per week (over the summer) was 27 hours; I did some of the hardware and research challenges but not all. But the time is all loaded in the projects. I spent almost 230 hours on the 3 projects combined! And I was part of a large team that worked diligently on Project 3. I expect to get an A, but with the projects there is a real limit to how much time you can take out and still have them work. The difference between A and B is optimization, but the projects have to work in the first place and there is a very real danger you will not be able to get them working in the time you have if you are doing this class over the summer and have other demands (like, say, a job). They start hard (compared to what you know) and get progressively harder. I really struggled to get Project 1 working properly. Project 2 is straightforward but tedious (A*/dynamic programming) and probably there is too much of it; it belabors the point. Project 3 is just very hard, period - I had to really research it on my own and try lots of approaches that failed before one worked. Definitely do a team for Project 3, and study extra early (read Probabalistic Robotics, and read on your own, don't rely on the lectures).",

The course teaches python along the way without you knowing it. All the problem sets are available in the udacity free course along with solutions and thus 30 points are assured. However, the projects require intuition into the topics taught in class. The runaway robot project is available on udacity and this was our first project. There is an optional project being added in this semester which may become mandatory for future offerings and then this course could require more time. Overall, I enjoyed this course. The only con is the lectures are so light that it makes the concepts deceptively simple, however you have to do lot of searching on the net to gain a deep understanding.',

            review: "The structure of the class means there's a lot of work at times, and then it's pretty dead other times. You begin with six weeks of fairly interesting lectures + online assignments that aren't too crazy. Then you have three weeks or so to complete the first project. If you had a good grasp on the lecture material it takes maybe 3 to 5 hours to come up with a working solution, though I spent 20+ hours trying and failing at the extra credit portion. Then the class ends with a larger project that definitely requires you to comprehend and do research beyond what was covered in the lectures. You can work alone or in groups up to four. I valued working in a group to be able to bounce ideas off others. In the end probably spent 5 to 10 hours a week for the five weeks we had to work on it. There was also an extra credit option where you actually build a robot and implement some of the ideas of the course, though unfortunately I did not get time to engage with that aspect of the course.\nCompared to other classes this one had a less interaction with staff or other students, perhaps because enrollment is smaller and there were less assignments. The instructors were not particularly active on Piazza. There were three office hours which were constantly rescheduled and even with few Piazza posts there was often slow turnaround for responses. There was a small group of students, though, who were quite active and helpful.",

With two lecturers listed as being in charge of this course, you would think that one of them take the lead and run the show. As it turned out, however, neither of them seemed to be particularly interested in putting in any more than the bare minimum amount of effort and the whole course was more or less run by the two teaching assistants. The end result was one of the deadest courses I have taken in this entire program. This might not have been so bad, except for the fact that the two major projects for this course don't really match what has been taught in the lecture videos. That means that in order to actually get through the projects, you pretty much have to go out and learn some pretty difficult material by yourself without any instructor support. With better instructors and projects that better mapped to the lectures, this could have been a really great course. As it is, I would steer clear unless you're looking for a course with a relatively low time commitment to pair with something harder and don't really care too much about learning anything.",

A reasonable leap to expect from masters students, especially with high level collaboration encouraged on Piazza.\nThe final project requires skills at a 10/10 level. No further instruction is provided. The grading is adversarial (based on your success compared to others), destroying the piazza community.\nI would still consider this course, very carefully, for a full length semester.

You could front-load, which is useful when you have vacations going on during the summer.\nThe lectures are deceptive. A lot of times in the quizzes, Dr. Thrun says, "It\'s ok if you can\'t figure this out, just view the answer, " which means you can coast through the Udacity lessons. What he really needs to say is, "If you don\'t understand the math for this, run away, far, far, away. " Because, when it comes time for the projects, you will need to implement some of these algebra or calculus functions on your own. My math skills are weak (and I\'m working on bringing them up with outside coursework because math is the foundation for all that we do) and my mathematical programming skills (especially for Python) weaker.\nI understand that from my personal perspective, I was not "ready" for this course. And the shortened schedule of summer semester means if you aren\'t ready, you are either expecting a moment of genius, or are going to drop the course. You can guess which one I chose. Others with a deeper background and familiarity with the basic concepts presented in the course, and an understanding of the logical processes required, will do just fine. If you are one of those people, fantastic! I hope to be at your level someday soon.',

The lectures were fun, although Professor Thrun's relentless encouragement seemed sarcastic at times. I certainly agree with other reviewers when they said certain concepts were only mentioned in passing before having to implement them in the next section, but since you could always look at the answer, it didn't seem like as much of a road block.\nThe rest of the class seemed like a disaster. Thrun's lack of interaction with the class, although understandable, was certainly a bummer. The TAs seemed like they were planning on dropping there interaction level from the start. Strict adherence to policy with little to no personal responsibility for actually nurturing understanding. They dangled an extra-credit-carrot for piazza posts, which is just stupid at a fundamental level. You have a torrent of answers from C students instead of just the normal overachievers; it made piazza pretty much unusable.\nThe pacing of the course is also completely out-of-whack. In the beginning it seems like you can just do a lecture a week and you will be fine, as they take only an hour or so. By the final lecture you are having to do additional research and re-watch videos in order to understand the concepts and they end up taking much longer. By the time the projects start (if you don't front-load) you feel like you are constantly playing catch-up. This only adds to the stress you feel because the projects don't really line up with any of the lectures.",

I will admit that I have no prior experience in robotics and I felt that I will learn the concept along the way. The lectures were frustrating , skim in details and glossed over necessary mathematics to gain a deeper understanding of the concepts. I spent many hours over them but was still not able to understand the maths. The TAs though active did not do anything to help you understand these concepts. The office hours with Dr Thrun were of no help either.\nI just felt that they are deliberately trying to hand over B’s and C’s to students. You can confirm that from grade distribution for Spring 2016 where only 48% people got an A as opposed to 80% in earlier semesters. I have no problem with getting a lower grade as long as the subject simulates my thinking and helps me understand the concept. I wasn’t able to grasp any concept taught in the class , as the projects did not require any application of the concepts. This course might have been tolerable in the past when 80 - 90% people got an A when the instructors understand that the material provided in this course is too superficial and graded accordingly. But instead of improving the quality of the course , they decided to add vigor by making testing harness hard and by ensuring that 50% people should get B or lower. If you miss one single test case , you will lose 10 - 12 points and then there is no coming back. (Hint : Please confirm for runway robot1 , which values can be negative. It will be obscurely defined and if you miss it you will be done. )\nIf you get lower marks in project 1 , promptly withdraw from this course. (No please don’t fall for we will consider hardware and software challenges if you are in between grades. There were 5 software challenges and 4 hardware challenges and if you do them all , they will account for 1 mark. ). Stay away or learn all maths before hand.',

            review: "I enjoyed this class. The content was very interesting and the TAs were helpful and active on Piazza. Content was completing problems on Udacity (24%) in Weeks 1 to 6, runaway robot (36%) and the final project of predicting the future location of a small robot (hexbug) (40%). I think the course was a lot harder than some of these reviews suggest.\nThere were two types of challenges for extra credit: research challenges and hardware challenges. I believe the research challenges were new this semester and consisted of finding an article relevant to the Udacity content in Weeks 1 to 6 and writing a Piazza post about it. One research challenge was due at the end of each week. Hardware challenges consisted of creating an electronic project.\nThe research and hardware challenges were only counted towards a higher grade if you are at the borderline between grades (if you earn a B but you are very close to an A, if you do well in the challenges you will be pushed up to an A).\nWith the benefit of hindsight, I wish I had not done the research challenges, or at least spent a lot less time on them. Finding papers at the right level took a bit of time and writing about each research paper took more time than it deserved. My time would have been better spent progressing with the Udacity videos. This would have given me more time to do the Runaway Robot project and Final Project. Oh well, shoulda, woulda, coulda!\nI guess the same could be said about the hardware challenge but as I enjoyed playing around with electronics versus writing I don't regret doing those challenges. My advice for future students is unless you are quick or enjoy the challenges skip them and focus on the core work.\nLastly, I would like to comment on the grade distribution in these unofficial course surveys. The grade cut off for an A is 90% but in these course reviews 75% of people received an A so I suspect these reviews are not a true reflection of current grade distribution.",

The mathematics are not very advanced or sophisticated (trig, probability, and some calc), but they can be a stumbling block in the projects. This is a good summer class, or something to pair with a crazy hard class -- there isn't really enough material in the course to fill a full semester.\nThe problem sets from lecture are very simplistic. It typically required more time to figure out how to perform the required actions using their custom implementation of a matrix class (with a very un-pythonic API) than to actually solve the problems. It is possible to frontload all of the lecture material, but you can't get too far ahead because the project details were not released until much later.\nIt seems like the staff is well aware of the issues, because the bulk of the final grade (~75%) comes from one individual project and a group final project, and they encouraged \"optional\" pseudo-extra-credit assignments to research and/or implement many of the more advance concepts (beyond the scope of lectures). The individual project is available on Udacity, but don't work too far ahead until they release all of the details. The group project is... a group project (yuck!) with scores determined (in part) through competition with the other teams (ugh). In both projects, it isn't clear what the learning objectives are, since the techniques taught in the class typically produce very poor results without extensive additional effort, while other techniques often perform surprisingly well with very little effort.\nThe class seems designed to run on autopilot for the staff, and peer learning is limited because the material does not lend itself well to group discussion -- especially on the final project where discussion with other teams may cost you a competitive advantage.",

I am an accomplished programmer, and that helped, but I should've taken a linear algebra refresher before this class. Also, I would suggest those who do not program or have very little coding experience NOT take this class until you've had some experience coding or at least really understand the math (linear algebra and trig) that is necessary. While the sheer number of lines of code necessary isn't huge, the application of the concepts require some experience with programming languages (preferably Python but you can pick Python up if you know Java or C). Also, reading other comments here, they've made some changes to the course. Submission of Project 1 is no longer via Udacity. The Udacity grader is still in place and you can use it for testing, but your submission is via tSquare. Finally, I agree the videos could've contained a little more in depth content, as the concepts needed for the projects are not covered in great detail in lecture. Outside research is required if you are not already familiar with the information. This can take more time than counted on but does lead to learning.",

In addition, he goes through concepts very quickly, so unless you already have some background knowledge on the topic, it's difficult to understand the concepts.\nMost of the topics in the class require solid math background (Calculus, Linear algebra, Probability and Statistics). If you are not good at math, forget it. I previously took CN, SDP, and KBAI and got A's on all of them, but had to drop this class due to problems with math.",

Professor Thrun is extremely positive and encouraging and makes you feel like you just solved the greatest problem when you complete an assignment.\nThe course allows you to work ahead at your own pace which is really important because the final project requires a lot more time and effort than the regular assignments so you want to \"front load\" this class to give yourself more time for the final project.\nDue to being able to complete the assignments ahead of schedule this class lends itself well to being done in parallel with another class by disciplined students (i. e. don't think you can leave stuff to the last minute, do it ahead of schedule and then relax ;) ).\nProfessor Thrun is busy running Udacity so he isn't generally involved on Piazza but the TA's are excellent and Dr. Thrun takes time about once a month to have live Q&A sessions with students.",

It's probably the first class I had that was almost entirely work at your own pace as you could finish all the assignments and the Runaway project as fast as you want.\nThe course on it's own can be easy, but if you really dig into the concepts I think it's rather challenging if not simply hard. I reviewed many lectures to really gain an understanding. That being said, you could easily do this course with another.\nThe only wildcard is the group project. In this program people have families, jobs... so coordinating with people all over the place can be challenging. I probably put more time in the last few weeks on the final project as I did the rest of the course.\nGreat class and you'll probably be thinking about the Runaway and Final project well after its over.",

Dr. Thrun's videos are really entertaining andinformative. The TAs are phenomenal. Probably the most engaged and verbose TAs I've encountered in the project. Ask a question and you'll get more detail than you'd have expected.\nI think this class just needs some way to push interacting with the rest of the class. I know a lot of people take it with another course. This makes sense due to the flexible timeline of completing projects, but it leads to people doing their work quietly and moving on. Which is a shame because this material can be dense and it's nice to be able to play ideas off of others.\nBut I definitely recommend it.",

Be sure to start to work on the final assignment early because it is harder than the rest of the course, I found myself running out of time while I still wasn't 100% finished with it. Also, brush up your python a bit to make things easier. The class is quite easy and a great companion course for Computer Vision or Computational Photography class if you can manage 2 classes a semester (I had a bit of prior knowledge in AI, computer vision and control theory, I found half of the course already familiar).",

The course is very manageable as all materials are in Udacity and are available right from the start. The video lectures are very easy to follow, however I feel that I need to do some work outside from what the course requires for the knowledge to be ingrained.\n(Update)\nSomeone asked if you get to learn more advanced techniques in AI4R...\nI am a total noob, so everything is advanced to me... I guess it is how you make of it. The course gives you many opportunities to learn more advanced techniques, but you can complete the course satisfactorily (I guess) without doing so.\nThroughout the lectures and the problem sets, it feels like you are being assisted like a 5 year-old: everything is well explained, you wouldn't notice much if you do not have a good grip. The problem sets are scored as all or nothing, but the answers are also provided so it seems to be just a matter of having tried or not tried. If you want to get more advanced, materials for advanced study are also provided, but it would not really hurt if you do not glance over them. It is easy to get complacent, until you get to the Runaway Robot and the Final Project, which are really challenging. You really needed to take a big leap, read a lot more and explore other possible algorithms to solve the problem. Most of my classmates talk about using an algorithm not even discussed in the lectures for solving the Final Project.\nThe TAs are very helpful. They do their best to up the participation, even create interesting videos every week. When somebody asks questions, they are quick to dive in. And when they do, they do not just answer: they give expounded explanations like how things might be different for other cases. But this course can actually be done even without interaction with others, so Piazza is sort of quiet.",

Also, the TAs were really helpful and know their stuff.\nThe class is divided into two parts (lectures with homework) and (two projects). The first part of the course is pretty straight forward. The second part has two projects: the first is the runaway project which involves some linear algebra. The second project is pretty open where you are free to implement any of the algorithms taught in the course to solve the problem. You can also use any other algorithm you want as long as you mention that in your report and say why you used that.\nTo prepare, I advise:\n\nhaving a python prior experience (Udacity: Intro to CS is a good refresher).\nArtificial Intelligence experience (briefly skimming through Udacity's Intro to AI lectures can be helpful)\n",

I had been hoping that it was 'beefed up' a bit for a graduate program but it's not.\nThe best part of this class is that Sebastian is a great teacher and enthusiastic about his work. While he doesn't participate much in the forums, he does conduct live office hours (or at least he did the semester I was taking it. ) This is where you can 'go deeper' on the material and learn from the master. This is really the best reason to take the class if you're interested in robotics. Sebastian is a 'god-amongst-men' in the world of robotics and you're unlikely to ever get so much valuable face time with somebody of his caliber as easily.\nThe projects are pretty easy. (KBAI and Computer Vision have way harder problems sets) The TAs were responsive and held regular office hours using Google Chat which allowed students to view them after the fact. (This skill set seems to allude TAs in other classes, so kudos to the AI for Robotic TAs for figuring this out. )\nThere is an allowance to let the students either propose their own projects or work on the 'assigned' final project. Due to an illness, I had to work on the assigned final project, which is what most of the class did anyway. Frankly this assigned final project is pretty much a waste of time and a 'fool's errand. ' While you apply what you've learned, very little of it makes much difference to the end results. Most teams perform not much better than random chance. We scored on the 'high side' of that Gaussian curve, but my suspicion is it had little to do with coding and more the random initial state. There were a few teams that applied some sophisticated CV + machine learning that performed better, but that has more to do with those skills than the Robotics AI taught in this class.\nI would highly recommend that you take advantage of the opportunity to propose your own robotics project. This will allow you to pick a problem that is directly related to robotics rather than the contrived one that seemed pretty pointless. If I had it to do over again, this is where I'd make my change.",

The lectures are structured to take full advantage of the Udactity integrated python enviroment. This makes it easy to make incremental advances in your understanding of the topics. I wish they covered a few more ways to apply the different types of filters. Each filter is explained in a particular context and without experience in the field it's difficult to see how it could be applied in another situation. Regarding, the projects, the first is pretty applicable and well designed. The second project seems to have little to do with the course material and you end up integrating something just for the sake of the project's requirements.",

This course has less of a heavy workload than many of the other courses, especially early on before the Runaway Robot and Final Project parts. Part of that is due to how streamlined the assignments are, the coding is built into the Udacity interface so you just write code and submit it like a normal quiz answer. I much prefer this method over the methods used in some of the other courses where you have to setup your own environment locally and worry about packaging everything up for graders to be able to reproduce it on their side. I spent a very long time on the final optional Runaway Robot part and completing it felt like a big accomplishment even though it was autograded like every other coding assignment, so just because there is an autograder doesn't mean all of the assignments are easy. The Final Project is extremely open-ended and lets you explore whatever topics from the course interest you and apply it to any domain. I really enjoyed that flexibility because I could choose a topic and project that I found interesting and wanted to put a lot of time into. You will need to write Python code for all of the assignments but as long as you have some programming experience you should be okay, if you find yourself lost early on you can probably learn Python from other resources online as you are taking this course. Overall I highly recommend this course, especially if you are taking another course with a heavy workload and want an interesting course that you will learn a lot from that is more flexible on time.",

You get the best of both world, a lot of heavy concepts, but a lot of real world examples. Don't plan on Sebastian being very available in the forums or weekly office hours, remember he's got 4 jobs (at least), but when he does, it is so much fun. I was able to join a team for the final project and work with a Lego MindStorms EV3 to implement PID line follower, localization and the start of a SLAM. It was awesome to be able to do our own proposal and our own work, much more engaging!",

            review: 'The Runway Robot project required some thinking and additional readings because it is not very obvious how the concepts learned in class can be applied to Runaway Robot. The final project is challenging. Most of the time will be spent on research and trial and error. It is recommended to work as a team instead of tackling it by yourself. More people can try different approaches.',

Course covers several filter variants (histogram filters, Kalman filters, particle filters) as well as path planning and some basic control algorithms. The course could perhaps have been faster paced and covered more, but the slow pace allowed the opportunity to do some further self study. The runaway robot and final project allowed the opportunity to apply course concepts and additional self study. I'd highly recommend this course.",

The guy had indepth knowledge of everything related to robotic, AI, and self-driving cars. The course content was pretty easy. The projects could be done with minimal effort or with extrodinary effort depending on how much you want to put into the class and therefore get out of it. The inline quizes were perfectly paced and helped solidify concepts before building on them. Everything is done in Python and nothing very complicated is required.',

The flow of the class is great and you always know how you're doing in the class and what you have to accomplish each week. The TAs, Herman and Jon, were excellent and very active on the forums. Professor Thrun keeps the lectures interesting and shows great enthusiasm for the topic.\nUltimately though I didn't feel like I got what I wanted out of the course. The connection to robotics was superficial, all of the code is in Python with no hardware required. The algorithms taught are used in robotcs but I didn't feel like we went in depth enough into them that I can comfortably remember how to use them without looking them up again. The class could honestly use a required hardware component (rather than extra credit as it is now) to flush out the classes connection to robotics.\nIt has a group project component worth 40% of your grade. The group project has the flaws of any group project in an online course, being tough to coordinate with other team members and no way to hold them accountable.",

I really enjoyed Sebastian's lectures and he is BY FAR my favorite instructor through 4 classes of this program. In the summer our final project was to predict the future path/projection of this incredibly random-moving toy thingy. The other projects were great, but this one was very hard to relate to the rest of the class. I would have preferred a different final project having to do more with the class contents, but it was still a great class and I'm sure they will change up the projects from semester to semester.",

            review: "Well designed syllabus to engage the student using practical examples as motivation, hiding away most of the math in the process. On the other hand, more materials could have been taught and so it requires your own initiatives to go further. It's a little wasteful to treat this as a full semester's module. Given Sebastian's schedules, expect his involvements to be very minimal. It takes a very helpful and knowledgeble TA and an engaging piazza community to get the course going. Design of the final project wasn't very well considered, as you couldn't really apply the knowledge. One classmate proposed his own idea, which I thought was way cooler. go google github for py-fire or something, Would be super awesome if the community can take his project, develop further into future assignment for the course.",

            review: 'The best class I have taken in the program so far! The material is largely self-paced, so you can get way ahead if you choose to. Professor Thrun is very entertaining and holds regular office hours to answer student questions in a Q&A format. You do not need the book at all for this course! I purchased it thinking I would reference it, but only cracked it open once or twice and would not buy it again. The only criticisms I would make are that the assignments make use of a custom Matrix() class, whereas students could probably get a little extra Python learning in if the assignments used numpy. Also, with the exception of the Runaway Robot Project #5, the class is almost a little too easy. I hate to use that word because the concepts are pretty advanced, but the assignments are more or less spoon fed to some degree. Overall, I highly, highly recommend taking this course and recommend that other instructors use this course as a template when designing new courses!\nEDIT: While I still highly recommend this course, I wanted to make a note of the grading policy. There are 6 lectures, each of which has some programming assignments associated with it. The total points for all assignments is worth 24% of the class grade, without any partial credit per week. The runaway robot project is worth 36% of the class grade, with up to a 12% extra credit opportuniy for finishing part 5. Part 5 was pretty difficult (Professor Thrun admitted to giving up on it) and less than 10 students to my knowledge finished it. The final project is worth a whopping 40% of the class grade and is very open ended with minimal opportunity for extra credit (3 teams total). To me it seems that the final is worth a little too much and the weekly assignments are not worth quite as much as they should be. I ended up with a grade that I am very happy with, but it came a little too close for comfort ;) Perhaps I was too busy enjoying the class?',

If you take other OMSCS classes like computer vision you will see some of the same topics covered more rigorously. What makes it interesting is the office hours with Dr. Thrun - so even if you are completely comfortable with the material, it is worth viewing the office hours to hear him answer questions. The other part of the course that is nice is the final project and optional hardware challenges allow you the chance to try to apply the concepts to real systems. If you want to get the most from the class you should try those optional challenges because you'll learn far more about robotics if you start trying to make them work on actual robots :).",

Dr. Thrun's live and direct involvement in this class is nothing short of amazing and awe-inspiring. This triumvirate is the essence of why one should aspire to be computer scientists and roboticists!\nWhile I wholeheartedly agree with my peers and don't dispute their personal experience gained from this class, I felt that I had some difficulty in some areas because of my lack of recent knowledge in certain areas. That's why I spent so much time, mostly in catching up, then in applying that to the contents of this class.\nWith respect to team project, I consider myself lucky that I was able to choose my team mates and that my team mates chose me. We had excellent synergy and I have to humbly admit that they carried me quite a bit in this course. That made a great difference in team project experience!\nI wished I was more prepared before taking this course, but not having taken any ML or CV courses weighed heavily against me. If I did, I may have shared my fellow classmates' sentiments.\nAs it stands, I learned quite a bit, more than I expected when walking into this class.
