            review: "Registered for this course as soon as it became available through BuzzPort. I would say, a fairly thought-provoking, if not unimaginative, course. I did learn a decent amount, but the course uses outdated journalistic tools (considering we live in a tech-driven era) - feather quill pens and parchments, blotting paper, as well as typewriters. Final exam involves creating your own paperweight design using mathematical modeling for perfect weight distribution and stability. A lot of the class is just getting over the initial frustration of not understanding the tools of the trade, then getting a flimsy grasp of that “je ne sais quoi” of writing, holding on to that thought for dear life, and then finally hoping the curve would be up-bended (or upended?, or bent up?) at the very end.\nOverall, if you like Scribbling, you will most likely enjoy this course, and if you don't - this class will probably be somewhat entertaining. Win-win!\nMy background:\n25 years old, recently married (although currently in legal separation process) with two kids, finished undergrad in 2017.\nCoding Experience: Very little (academic experience with several languages, mostly writing LISP interpreters and C-to-Assembly code translation)\nWriting Experience: Moderate (4 published short-form novels, Pulitzer Prize finalist in Fiction in my sophomore year)\nMath Experience: Strong (completed Tensor Analysis, Algebraic Topology, and Stochastic Calculus in my first semester)",

        'summer 2019':
            "The course offers a thought-provoking experience, albeit reliant on outdated journalistic tools such as quills and typewriters, which some found frustrating. While students reported learning a decent amount, they struggled with the unconventional methods and the final exam's unique requirement to design a paperweight using mathematical principles. Despite this, those who enjoy creative writing may find the course entertaining, while others might feel more challenged. With the backdrop of a personal journey, including a recent marriage and young children, the reviewer highlights a solid foundation in writing and math but suggests a disconnect between the course content and modern journalistic practices. Overall, it may suit scribblers but could disappoint those seeking contemporary approaches.",
