            review: "I don't understand the hate for this course. Sure it is not a programming class and it never pretended to be. Some may dislike Garner's approach to handholding of going through step by step in every Excel cell but I don't think this was the point of it.\nLearning how to read and understand financial statements requires a different modality of thinking to learning a programming language, library, or framework. As such, it requires a different approach to learning the content and I think Garner did an amazing work with this.\nThe material itself is dry, but it has nothing to do with the quality of the class but rather the subject matter in itself. Having this understanding will be helpful in the long run of your career.",

            review: 'There is a lot of very useful content in this course about discounted cash flow analysis, stock/bond valuation, capital budgeting, etc... The lecture videos are very good, the professor knows her stuff and is very clear in the videos.\nFor the homeworks you can simply follow the videos, fill out the spread sheets, and get it done, it is not that bad but tedious sometimes, some little bugs getting fixed but fine nbd.\nIf you want to actually understand what the spread sheet is doing and all the nuances of the different pots of money for a business you may need to invest a little more effort.  Honestly this is all extremely useful information to know in career (capital budgeting, net present value, depreciation expense, you want 1 Million dollars worth of new servers for the company how does that effect the cashflows of the business?..) and life (loan amortization, stock evaluation, how bonds work....).  This is a nice course and a good break from getting slammed by harder grind it out coding courses.',

There is totally no critical thinking needed in this class. Just follow the steps and you get your A. Any deviation would be deemed wrong and you will get a B.\nIf you like something in which you prefer a huge commanderie, consider the Analytical Tools Track courses like ISYE 6740 Computational Data Analysis.\nIf you expect more of a stock market/investment focus, then ironically you should consider Computational Track courses like CS 7646 Machine Learning for Trading instead.\nIt is exactly such courses like this that make this track that disparaging.',

The HWs are mostly filling in the blanks in excel sheets, in most cases the formulas are exactly the same as in the demo so you just need to copy and paste.\nThe project is essentially a bigger version of the HWs and again very easy but can be fiddily just because of the amount manual calcs there are in balance sheets and forecasts\nI needed an easy course to pair with a harder course and this satisfied that. It's an easy A whether you decide to try and learn the material or not, I think there are some useful things in here like learning to read balance sheets and Statement of Cashflows etc. but the easy format of the class means you'll only retain the info if you really are interested it, which i wasnt",

Basically you can go in without any financial modeling experience and leave without learning anything while scoring an A. 80-90 percent of this course is basically following step by step instructions on how to fill up an excel model.

            review: 'I don\'t mind an easy class, and I surely am not insisting on taking only classes that take 20+ hours/week, so my complaint about this class not that it is "easy" like most reviews imply this is the problem. My problem with this class is that it forces you to watch lectures and follow them blindly on excel, and if you even dare to think and do things slightly differently, even if you end up with the same answer, then you will be penalized. Any class in this program, even DVA or CDA or BDFHC will seem "easy" if you are given a tutorial video and all you have to do is to follow it blindly, and although this makes it easier not only for the students, but also for the instructor and the TAs, still this will usually results in students learning nothing.\nThe slack channel for this class is dead, and the few posts on Piazza are  mostly asking for how to name their files, and there is barely any useful discussion, and I guess it is because everything is spoon-fed to the extent that you loose the desire to learn. Yes, the instructor and the TAs are professional and responsive, but why wouldn\'t they when it seems that they are required to do the least effort compared to any other class in the program.\nSo how to improve this class? Give assignments that require the students to think and learn. It will require more effort from the TAs because students will then be asking questions and the assignments will not be auto-evaluated anymore, but at least then the students will graduate from the class learning something!!!!',

Very thorough.\n•\tLearned some tricks in Excel\n•\tThis could be good or bad, but the professor is very thorough\nCONS\n•\tWeekly lectures for HW and cases can be quite long. Many times, 2-4 hours. (But, when I think about it, a 3-credit on-campus course has ~3-hours of lectures per week, so I suppose this is inline.)\n•\tThe cases were VERY painful for me. Not hard, but VERY tedious, take a long time (videos), and not topics I enjoyed (mainly, creating different financial statements).\n•\tA lot of following the leader (i.e., you mimic what the teacher does).

            review: 'I came into the course highly knowledgeable in Microsoft Excel.  Generally, I find Excel to be overly utilized.  This course reinforces ways to use Excel when better tools exist.  For example, I can now do matrix multiplication in Excel when these operations should be in a tool like R.\nThat said, Excel is still heavily used in many companies globally.  The assignments were incredibly easy video examples walked thru every step cell by cell.  You just have to copy and paste into the actual homework or project assignments.  Also, many of examples provided were very manual compared to more efficient methods.  For example, depreciation values were looked up using a nested IF statement with cell by cell reference rather than a simple vlookup.  Because of the macro grading, using a more advanced formula was discouraged.   Marcro grading also required following steps exactly even if you could achieve the right end result.\nThe professor is very knowledgeable and helpful.  Her office hours were fun but not really necessary to attend.\nIn summary, the course is very easy but tedious (long videos) but I did enjoy the professor.',

            review: "I marked this class as 'easy' in the difficulty ranking, but in reality I would call it - low stress. It will probably take 5 hours per week in a regular (Fall/Spring) semester. Some weeks took more, and a few weeks took less.\nMost of the time I spent watching the lecture videos and following along with a spreadsheet. At first I thought that might be boring, but I did learn a few things with optimization and VBA. Also learned some techniques to use Excel to perform some matrix math. I found many times, I could watch the videos at 1.5x speed. But then sometimes I'd go back and rewatch sections.\nI think I understand the financial formulas better after taking Financial Modeling, than when I took the Business Fundamentals course - where they give a bunch of terms and formulas to memorize. In addition to financial formulas, I have a better understanding of some of the math concepts behind them. Maybe it's just me, but how Covariance works and what it can be used for makes more sense after this course.\nDr. Garner was active in Piazza and on every Office Hour that I attended (I attended most of them). The TA's were responsive as well. Office hours were not a required attendance, but I attended many because I enjoyed them.\nI'm not sure if this is true of the other Business electives, but this class had less than 100 students, so the forums and office hours felt more personal. Another plus to FM - there are no exams. There are 4 or 5 individual homework assignments and 4 group case studies (analyzing a company using different methods).\nI liked the way groups are done in this class. We were allowed to reach out to form our own groups during the first week or so, then anybody who couldn't find groups were assigned. She encourages us to come to agreement as a group to find a workload balance. She has a nice spreadsheet which each group member submits to help keep grading proportional to each member's effort.\nIf you are looking for a Business Track elective, then I would recommend Financial Modeling. You may even think about taking this before the Business Fundamentals course, as some of the concepts are explained in easier to understand format - at least for me.",

            review: "This isn't the \"financial modeling\" class I thought it'd be with analyzing investments, forecasting economic trends, etc. In fact there's practically no modeling at all. It's more like MGT 8803's finance portion, except an entire semester's worth. Reviewing various financial statements and doing very simple math.\nThe only software we use is Excel. I learned a few new tricks there (like did you know you can do Matrix multiplication?? I didn't!) but generally didn't gain the type of knowledge I wouldn't have wanted. Not to say it had no use at all - I learned how to build a loan amortization table and figure out what would happen to my mortgage under various scenarios, as well as the aforementioned Excel skills.\nThere are a few individual homeworks, most of which can be completed by watching the lectures and copying what the instructor puts in the cell, letter-by-letter. There are also four group projects, which are like the homeworks but more involved. They're still fairly simple, you could probably do all four by yourself, but they're group projects. You also grade your group-mates' effort to ensure nobody slacks off. Lectures are pretty long but easy to follow, unlike other courses you won't need to watch them twice or look to outside resources.\nOverall quite easy, both in terms of difficulty and time involved. Also, the instructor Jacqueline is very kind and accommodating - if you want to pad your GPA without much effort or really want to learn more about balance sheets and statements of cash flows take this course. But if you want to do some in-depth analysis of different types of investments, learn how to predict how stock portfolios will behave, etc. you'll be disappointed by this.",

            review: "This was an interesting class, almost completely based on excel, and primarily covering the three statement model as well as some capital budgeting and structure stuff.\nI have almost no experience in finance, but DO have extensive excel experience, so I found this class to be pretty easy. And even if you are an excel beginner, the professor more or less walks you through just about everything anyway.\nSpeaking of the professor. I liked her.\nThe videos can run a little longer than what I've seen so far in other courses. And, you will have a team project (I hate team projects). Our team basically just all the the whole project and then compared notes. Then one of us would submit.\nMost interesting subject to me was the portfolio stuff where you try to optimize a portfolio to minimize risk free return using matrix algebra. I have never studied MPT or any of that, but I suspect this touched on the very basics of it. More of that, would be what I'd want to see.\nGood course, of the three business analytics track electives, this would probably be the most \"work\" but even still it's light compared to the omsa courses, let alone the cse ones.",

            "The course on financial statements has garnered mixed reviews. Some students find it challenging and time-consuming, noting that it took them over five hours to grasp the content, although they acknowledge Dr. Garner's dedication during office hours. Conversely, others appreciate Garner's step-by-step teaching style, arguing that the course effectively develops a different way of thinking about financial data, despite its dry subject matter. While some criticize the course for not being hands-on like programming classes, others value it as a helpful tool for future careers. Additionally, some view it as a lighter option amidst more demanding coursework, making it a welcome break from intensive studies.",

            'The course received mixed reviews from students. While some criticized it for being overly simplistic and frustratingly tedious, labeling it as "the dumbest course" they\'ve taken, others found the content on discounted cash flow analysis, stock, and bond valuation to be highly valuable. The professor was praised for her clear presentation in the videos, though some felt that merely following along wasn’t sufficient for deep understanding. Despite some minor technical issues and a perception of dryness, many acknowledged it as a useful course for practical financial skills needed in both careers and everyday life. The collaborative aspect was appreciated by those who had supportive group mates, contributing to a more positive experience.',

            "The course has garnered mixed reviews, primarily highlighting its simplicity and lack of depth. Many students find it exceptionally easy, likening it to a class for beginners, with one reviewer even achieving a 99.55% grade with minimal effort. While the material is described as interesting and potentially compatible with other courses, criticism is directed toward the teaching methods, particularly the repetitive and error-ridden videos that stifle creativity. Reviewers express frustration with strict grading policies, suggesting a need for more nuanced assessment due to the course's overall lack of challenge. Additionally, discontent is evident regarding the course's relevance within the OMSCS program, with calls for a rebranding to better reflect its focus on financial modeling for insurance agents.",
        'fall 2021':
            "The course receives mixed reviews, with many students finding it too simplistic and lacking in critical thinking. It is characterized as low-effort and low-commitment, demanding only that students follow step-by-step instructions to achieve high grades, which some feel diminishes the rigor expected at the Master's level. Critics argue that this approach hinders genuine learning, as deviations from the prescribed methods lead to lower grades, even when results are correct. While the instructor and TAs are noted for their professionalism and responsiveness, the overall course design seems to stifle engagement, leaving students unmotivated. Suggestions for improvement include incorporating more challenging assignments that encourage critical thinking and active participation.",
        'summer 2021':
            "The course is characterized as easy, with homework primarily involving filling in Excel sheets where formulas often mirror those from demonstrations, making it simple to copy and paste. While the project expands on homework assignments, it remains straightforward but can be cumbersome due to manual calculations involved in balance sheets and forecasts. Many students appreciate its role as an easy option alongside more challenging courses, noting some useful lessons in financial statements. However, criticisms include a lack of depth and engagement, with some reviewers describing it as repetitive and overly simplistic, suggesting that it caters more to GPA padding than substantial learning. Overall, the experience varies greatly depending on students' prior knowledge and interest in the material.",
        'spring 2021':
            "The course offers a structured introduction to financial modeling, making it accessible even for beginners, with many students enjoying the step-by-step approach and earning good grades easily. The teaching team is highly praised for their responsiveness and engagement, providing well-organized lectures and insightful assignments that contribute to learning Excel techniques. However, several reviewers express disappointment regarding the course's lack of challenge, as it often feels like mimicking the instructor rather than fostering independent problem-solving skills or curiosity. Some students sought a more investment-focused curriculum but found the content to be more aligned with financial statements, which some found tedious and unengaging. Overall, the course is recommended for those interested in finance but may not meet the needs of students seeking deeper analytical challenges.",
        'fall 2020':
            'Overall, the course is perceived as easy, with many students noting that achieving an A is quite attainable, especially with minimal effort. Homework and case studies align closely with lecture materials, making them straightforward. However, some students warn that this ease may come at the cost of learning, advising that engagement is crucial for those wanting deeper understanding. Professor Garner receives praise for her kindness, responsiveness, and clear explanations. While this class can be a less time-consuming option alongside tougher courses, those seeking to genuinely learn are encouraged to participate actively and utilize office hours to maximize their experience.',
        'spring 2020':
            "The course offers a mix of ease and valuable learning, particularly for those seeking to enhance their Excel skills and financial modeling abilities. Reviews commend the professor's knowledge and support, with engaging office hours and personalized interaction due to the small class size. However, many felt the instruction was overly simplistic, often providing step-by-step guidance that limited independent exploration. While practical skills in Excel and financial analysis were gained, some assignments relied on outdated methods, and grading was rigidly macro-based. Students appreciated the low-stress environment and the absence of exams, though they noted that the content could feel tedious with lengthy videos and repetitive tasks. Overall, it's deemed suitable for business track students but not rigorous enough for those seeking advanced analytics training.",
        'summer 2020':
            'The course offers an easy learning experience that reinforces concepts from introductory business classes, allowing students to complete homework while watching videos. However, many reviews criticize the lecture videos as tedious and lacking depth, often requiring students to merely replicate formulas in Excel without engaging with the material. While the numerical solutions for case studies provide a way to verify answers, the overall feedback indicates a desire for more critical thinking and discussion in the curriculum. Despite the criticism, some learners appreciate the increased familiarity with accounting statements gained from the course.',
        'spring 2019':
            "The course offers a straightforward introduction to financial statements and Excel skills, making it accessible and manageable for students. Positive aspects include a kind and accommodating instructor, easy-to-follow lectures, and useful tools like loan amortization tables. However, many students feel misled, as the course lacks the in-depth financial modeling and investment analysis they expected. Assignments are simple and can often be completed by closely following lecture instructions, leading to a perception of minimal challenge. While it may serve those looking to enhance their understanding of basic finance concepts, it disappoints those seeking rigorous training in investment forecasting or complex financial analysis. Overall, it's suitable for GPA padding but may not meet the needs of serious finance students.",
        'fall 2019':
            "The course offers a strong foundation in finance, focusing heavily on Excel and financial modeling, which many students found manageable, even those with little finance experience. The professor's support and guidance were praised, making the content accessible. However, the length of video lectures was noted as a drawback, and team projects were unpopular among students, often leading to uneven participation. The portfolio optimization segment intrigued students, but they expressed a desire for more depth in this area. Overall, while the course demands some effort, it is perceived as less intensive compared to other electives in the business analytics track.",
