            review: 'When to take:\nI took this course in the Summer and I believe that is the mistake I made. Every weekend you have a project which makes it very difficult with work, so will highly recommend taking this course during either Spring or Fall.\nAssignment and Lectures:\nThe course content is easier and a very good introduction to someone who has no/less financial knowledge so worked great for me.\nThe assignments are straightforward but do take time to understand or sometimes make it work in the environment so I will highly recommend putting enough time there.\nREAD THE REQUIREMENTS PROPERLY! I made the stupid mistake of not reading the requirement properly for one assignment and lost 20 points. Since the assignments are easy, these requirements matter a lot.\nMost time consuming assignments are assignment 3 and 8 so start early for these.\nQuizzes:\nThe questions are confusing which I think is on purpose to ensure that you understood the concept and might make you lose points, since this course has a pre-defined grade structure, I will recommend putting time for lectures properly.\nStaff:\nSuper helpful staff and TAs, great response time and provides great resources. In case of any doubt, post a question and they will respond lighting fast. Not exaggerating, they have done that.\nOverall I will recommend this to anyone who has less financial knowledge and would try to experiment with this domain.',

            review: "Overall, it's not a bad class. Not as much programming as classes like AOS and HPC, was less of a challenge than those classes. But still, it's well run\nA lot of your grade comes from projects which have super long and specific requirements. The hardest part on the projects isn't the actual dev work, just reading the requirements and getting them all in your head at once (kind of like HPCA in this respect)\nMy favorite part about this class was the more finance-oriented part. Personally, I had a lot of blind spots going into this class (e.g. didn't know what hedge funds are or what options trading is). It helped cover those blind spots\nI would totally be into taking some hypothetical course with Professor Balch that's 100% about finance",

            review: 'This was my 3rd course in the program (after AI4R that I loved and KBAI that I hated). The course was a mixed bag for me but overall I\'m not regretting taking it (unlike KBAI that has no right to exist).\nI work in finance and hence was not looking to learn much on the "trading" side of the course (which I think was a bit rudimentary). My goal was to have an intro to ML. With that, I think this course suited my goals, albeit requiring more work than was necessary for that.\nI think I gained some basic intuition on the supervised learning (regressions, decision/random trees, ensemble methods) and reinforcement learning (Q learning with or w/o dyna). On top of that, I learned how to use Python (scipy) optimizer and (my favorite) how to vectorize in pandas and numpy - that really speeds things up while making the code neat at the same time.\nOn the negative side:\n\nExcessive amount of additional reading, most of which is useless (e.g. Handbook of AI and Big Data Applications in Investments - the book describes some use cases but it really does not teach you anything. Yet, the chapters are quite lengthy and takes a lot of time to read)\nProjects are quite intense, especially for the Summer. Project 6 (on technical indicators) took me long time despite having a lower weight. Obviously projects 3 and especially 8 were very time consuming, it was unreasonable to give only 1 week to complete them.\nExams - it was not clear at all what these exams were supposed to assess. Very strange questions formulated using un-human English.\nNot a deal breaker, but some of the lectures are of a very poor quality. I really struggled to hear or see something on some of the videos.\n',

            review: "I'm not sure how or why ML4T exists in this program. It feels like an intro level undergrad course. The only reason you should take ML4T is if you want easy credits or have never taken a programming class before.\nThe course content is very outdated and extremely easy if you're decent at coding. Additionally, the Joyner style reports hold your hand to such a degree it's actually difficult to lose points as long as you're referencing the rubric when you write them.\nAvoid this class if your goal is to learn. You'll gain more knowledge and achieve better trading results by watching a few YouTube tutorials that cover modern trading methods.",

This class really taught me how to use Python for some pretty cool projects and is a great introduction to Machine Learning. Some of the projects are more difficult than others and are weighted appropriately. The concepts taught are very interested, especially those are actively invest and you learn a lot of important information from the financial side.\nI recommend trying to get ahead as all of the projects and lectures are posted, especially if you have travel plans as during the summer semester there was a project due every Sunday.',

I Took this during the summer so there were weekly assignments, the assignments were pretty straight forward but it takes some time to write the report associated to them covering all the rubrics.  All the instructions were very detailed and clear and every time I had doubts about the instructions all of them were already answered in the Ed discussion forum. Most of the questions from the exam come from the obligatory readings and not from the lectures.",

            review: 'Overall I am pleased with the knowledge I gained taking this course, and I believe that the projects built well toward the "capstone" project 8.\nHowever, my biggest criticism of this course is the (unnecessarily) long project instructions with (imbalanced) penalties in their grading rubrics.\nThis produced in me a frustration with how difficult it was to glean specific project requirements out of these long-winded project specs and how harsh a penalty for missing just one of those requirements might have on your project grade. Honestly, I feel like the current state of project instructions/grading is a bad representation of the student\'s achievement of the desired learning objectives (as stated in section 1.1 of each of the project instructions).\nWhat it felt like to me as a student, and I am apparently not alone in this perspective, is that your score on projects in this course was less of a measure of how well you could understand and implement the machine learning and trading concepts taught in the course, and much more a measure of how well you could read these instruction documents.\nThis is compared to the other 3 classes I have taken so far in the OMSCS program (AI, RAIT, and GA), where this issue of convoluted expectations for assignments was not a problem. For example, I personally felt that the projects in AI (6601) were much more challenging conceptually but the expectations were much more clearly communicated, so getting a good grade on those assignments was actually easier! (for me, mileage may vary)',

            review: "Pros:\n\nyou will learn some stock trading term&knowledge that is useful and fun to know nowadays\nWell organized course material overall with 8 projects and 2 exams with detailed criteria\nDiscussion page with lots of students asking question and TAs are actively answering it (I admitted that I didn't use that very often and mostly for complaining my regrading process sorry but I think people are there to help)\nCons:\n4 out of 8 projects needs you to write somewhat formal reports with some unnecessary details you need to follow(or not if you don't mind lose a chunk of points) which I think is better just convert into several canvas questionnaires\nunlike the strict report requirement, the example codes are very sloppy with weird spacing, empty lines, inconsistent naming style, and you will have to manually type in your student ID and username. Function signature got changed from project to project even though they expect you to reuse the code. Pointing these out is that all those combined, I feel the unfairness where the instructor demands a lot of unnecessary details while s/he doesn't care at all the details.\nIn order to prevent GenAI usage, exam are now tuned so that it is also hard for normal human to read. Each exam contains 110 T/F questions but was advertised as 22 questions because for each 5 of them it will come with a irrelevant questions header, making it a multiple choices questions. I got caught off-guard and did pretty bad on my exam 1.\nRegrade process is taking forever and my issue never got resolved. This course is I think the most BUREAUCRATIC course I've ever seen. To be able to regrade your assigment, you will first need wait at least a day after the the TA's comments to be elligible for the regrading, BUT, not too late as after a week, you lose elligibility. I submitted regrading request 2/19 and never get any feedback until 5/5, a week before the semester ends. The TA gives feedback that is not relevant to what I asked and I was never able to get a second opinion after that.\nAll in all, I think for someone with limited python skills and enthusiast in stock trading might find this course very interesting, but if you are comfortable with one of a scripting language and just want to briefly broaden your horizon, the course might be a bit waste of time and you might find yourself, like me, lost in the red tape of OMSCS\n",

            review: "This course has very interesting content and gives a great, broad overview of a lot of ML concepts. The lectures were fun to watch, and the projects were interesting. I would have given this a 5, but there were a few things that were big detractors. In reality, I'd give this course a 3.5, but rounded down due to the detractors.\nFor starters, the exams are the worst exams I've ever taken. They're not the worst because of difficulty, they are just awfully written and impossible to study for. The exams are mostly on the readings, not the lectures, and the wording and format make them extremely poor tests of your knowledge. The instructional staff insists that the exams are good because of statistical measures, but they are so awful that every student I spoke to hated them. And they're worth more than a 1/3rd of your grade, so they can easily cause you get a letter grade lower than you expect.\nThe projects are interesting, but the reports are a huge pain, and the report instructions are long, but often missing key information. I had to scour the Ed Discussions forums for TA answers to questions to fully get the correct instructions for each report.\nUnfortunately, I feel like the reports and exams are bringing this course down. From what i've read, it seems like it used to be a much better course.",

            review: "Overall: This was my first OMSCS course along with one other. Overall, it's a very well-organized and well taught course. I would highly recommend it as a first course in the program and as a lighter introduction to machine learning without a strong math requirement. Stock market asset trading is an interesting machine learning domain for the projects. This course sets you up well with good tools and background for the OMSCS program in general.\nBackground: B.S. in Computer Science and 3.5 YOE as a SWE. No prior Python experience.\nIf you have no prior Python experience, Georgia Tech's course on EdX will prepare you for the Python background necessary for this course:\nhttps://www.edx.org/certificates/professional-certificate/the-georgia-institute-of-technology-introduction-to-python-programming?index=product&queryID=bde3583077b6ac1013a33913a38f71e1&position=5&linked_from=autocomplete&c=autocomplete\nIt is certainly possible to do well in this course with no prior Python experience. Just understand you will need to add in extra hours to what others may have reported here to learn Python and its libraries (and especially the ins and outs of graphing for report figures). I put in dozens of additional hours in the first 3 weeks to complete the Python certificates above to get the necessary background for the projects. Get the Python background ahead of time if you know you will take this course!\nProjects: My biggest advice is to start projects early and to carefully review project assignments and go through their rubric's grading your own assignments for reports. When in doubt, make sure you've answered a rubric component thoroughly. My biggest grade loss was due to small oversights on Project 6's report (60%). Project 3 and Project 8 are the most time intensive and difficult but certainly possible to do well on - I got 100% and 95% on them respectively. I found project 7 on Reinforcement Learning to be by far the most interesting! I honestly enjoyed every project in the course, however!\nReadings: I personally did all of them - they help on exams the most and tend not to be as necessary for the projects but can be good for citation material in reports.\nReports: Some students hated having to do these in addition to writing code for a project. You have to understand this is a graduate-level course to prepare you to be able to conduct research in machine learning, however. Therefore, communicating your experiments and methodologies is a useful skill. I didn't have much of this in my undergrad CS coursework (only in Biology) before so I enjoyed it. I also thought they helped me summarize and learn the material better. Start early and carefully review your submission like you're a grading TA with the rubric to make sure you've covered your bases and you'll do well.\nExams: The lectures, readings, and projects will help you prepare best. Never figured how to prepare well for these even though I did above average - they are time-pressured and difficultly phrased - they are not typically straightforward questions and sometimes hard to interpret. Sometimes I felt I knew the material for a question but was confused by the question itself. Time efficiency is the most important skill for the exams. I recommend making a table of contents for your notes in your notebook. Answer questions quickly and mark ones you're less sure on. Then return to those questions and use your notes or ChatGPT (which is allowed on exams in this course) on the questions you were less sure on with any remaining time.\nDifficulty: This is a demanding course especially if you don't have a Python background - be disciplined and don't take it lightly. An 'A' is certainly achievable, however. I ended the course with a relatively safe A (~93%) despite not having a Python background at the start.",

Ended with 98%.\n+: The readings are all pretty good IMO. I did all the readings and I thought that all but 1 of the textbooks are quite interesting.\n+: As long as you do the readings and watch the lectures, you will come away with decent (but shallow) knowledge of the ML landscape.\n+: You'll also come away with shallow knowledge related to finance and investing. Nothing you couldn't learn on your own though.\n+: Most of the projects are interesting and rewarding.\n-: Assignment requirements are disorganized. You can't find all the requirements just by looking at the rubric; instead you'll need to close read the entire project document, as well as read Ed posts. This is a strange choice, since it wouldn't be impossible to put all the requirements in one place.\n-: Projects are graded extremely slowly. If you're confident you're doing well and understanding everything, this is fine, but if you're struggling, you are not going to get feedback until it's too late. On top of that, many projects are built on previous projects, so that exacerbates the issue.\n-: The exam questions and answers are explicitly designed to confuse ChatGPT, because the exams are open-book and open-internet. Unfortunately, that means these questions are harder for people to understand too. The wording is unnecessarily opaque / vague. This affects everyone, but particularly unfairly hurts non-native speakers.\n• The first module was mainly about learning to use Numpy and Pandas. If you have no prior exposure to them (like me), that's probably good, otherwise, probably boring time.\nThe weak points of the course are real. That said, if you're interested in the subject, and confident that you'll do fine, you'll probably have a good time.",

Lectures average to about 1 hour per week, with readings (optional) averaging about 2 hours per week. Besides projects 3, 7, and 8, the rest were relatively easy and didn't take me more than a day, but they were still great applications of the concepts that we learned during lecture. I actually really liked project 3 because it was the first time I created a learning model from scratch, and project 8 was very satisfying because it was a combination of projects 3, 5, 6, and 7 together! If you are thinking about taking this class, I highly recommend it, and here is my advice for you: don't fall behind on lecture content, and make sure you give yourself ample time for each project. You will use the code you write for each project for a future project, so if you don't do well on one project, you will likely have to make it up. I also learned a lot about trading (didn't know anything before) and thought it was a great intro to financial concepts as well!",

            review: "This is a brilliant starter course for the OMSCS program. If you're rusty with programming and/or are picking it back after a long hiatus, this course would provide the perfect opportunity for you to ease back into it. It may also work out quite alright for people who haven't had any meaningful exposure to coding in the past, or come from a non-CS undergrad. On the other hand, if you're someone with an extensive programming base (i.e. doing this right after a rigorous CS undergrad or working in software engg./data science), this course may not offer all that much value. Maybe one of the easier courses out there to cruise through in the pursuit of getting closer to your degree. The Trading or ML knowledge at hand is quite superficial - it offers you inspiration, at best, to do your own research and figure out try out quantitative finance.\nIn terms of level of difficulty, I felt this course was similar to that of a year 2 or year 3 undergrad CS course - nothing too rigorous. If you score above 90 overall, you get an A. Although the faculty didn't officially post any stats on final grades distribution, looking at the distribution of individual project/exam grades, I wouldn't be surprised if at least 50% of the class ended up with an A. You have to put in effort, of course, and they will make you work for it, but grabbing an A is very much in sight. Personally, I would recommend absolutely ensuring all your project code passes through the tests they've designed, and adhering very meticulously to the grading rubric for all your reports/code. Getting 100% in all your assignments is completely within reach and practical. Exams are another thing though - you will almost certainly lose some points there, but nothing worth fretting over. Do your projects well, and the rest will take care of itself.\nFor what it's worth, I really enjoyed this course as a way of starting my OMSCS journey, getting back in touch with coding after years and building confidence again. Also didn't read any of the prescribed books and in hindsight, it wouldn't have mattered from a grades perspective anyway. I feel I'm now ready to take some of the more difficult courses and/or embark on any side projects myself.",

If you're new to python this structure is nice, but otherwise it felt like jumping through arbitrary hoops to get full credit.\nAI4R, ML, RL, and AI cover this content in more depth without nickel and diming you on the rubric.\nUnless you're interested in trading specifically, or want a lot of direction for projects, I don't think ML4T is worth the time.",

            review: "The content of the course is interesting and structured well. I believe this was the first semester they had the midterm and final exams as open book/internet - iirc the only restriction was no communication with other people during the exams. The questions seemed to be much more difficult than practice qns provided (which I believe reflects the exam style of previous semesters). Exams were not difficult but the wording of qns can be confusing and a 1hr time limit to review 100+ t/f statements means that you're generally working off of knowledge and only looking up a few qns here or there. Marks were scaled for exams - exam out of 110 and students would receive the mark out of 100. Essentially disregarding 10 incorrect answers.\nAs others have mentioned the assignments are extremely detail oriented. There is a long document with all the assignment requirements + a 1.5-2hr weekly TA session going over quiz answers and walking through the assignment. I got full marks on all the coding sections but lost marks on seemingly unimportant details in the report like a line color on a graph. It would be great if the auto-grader could provide more informative feedback as all the assignments are related. Receiving marks and feedback 4 weeks after submission sometimes delays progress on subsequent assignments. Start early on assignment 3 and 8 if you can, those are the most time consuming! Most other assignments required <5hrs to complete.\nI would recommend this as as starter course for OMSCS. Prof. Joyner is top notch, the content is interesting and not difficult. TAs are very responsive, make sure to keep an eye on Ed Discussions. It's a great course to ease back into studies.",

However, it is taught like an undergraduate course, so there is less personal responsibility, but the \"coddling\" takes up some unnecessary time.\nPros:\n-Great intro to ML\n-Easy, material isn't difficult to understand\n-Gives some good introductory material to ML and Finance\nCons:\n-Project and exam expectations are distributed across Ed discussion, weekly recorded office hours, and the course website. You need to read all of these very thoroughly to understand the expectations of the projects.\n-The reports are sometimes tedious. These aren't too bad but they take a lot of time and don't add much more value than a question/answer worksheet would.",

They could focus on more applicable concepts pertaining to quant trading (how to construct software systems to execute automatic trades, options theory, types of trading strategies, and so much more that they should’ve covered but didn’t). The graders are incredibly tough and will mark off points just because they feel like it when the work you’ve provided is perfectly sufficient. This course opened my eyes to nothing and taught me nothing I didn’t already know from other ML courses (the ML they teach us also taught poorly) and rudimentary research. Do not recommend this course.',

            review: "Sigh. I kinda wish I didn't take this course. The two main things I got out of it were: 1) don't try to beat the market (just invest in index funds) and 2) it turned me off from taking any other machine learning courses in the program.\nI'd rate the course as a whole a 4/5 for everything besides the final project, and a 2/5 for the final project. Also, I'd give it a difficulty of 3/5 for everything besides the final project and a 5/5 for the final project.\nI found the trading material the most interesting, but I doubt I'll ever utilize any of that knowledge in the real world. The machine learning topics were also interesting, but I don't feel like I gained a good grasp of them through the projects or readings.\nExams weren't bad considering I thoroughly reviewed the relevant lectures and readings. Both were essentially 110 T/F questions with 10 points being extra credit. There was a bit of a time crunch though as they only give you about an hour. I found that it helped to pace myself by only giving myself 30 seconds per T/F statement.\nThe TAs are great. Very, very responsive and very helpful. I also really enjoyed the lectures and the What Hedge Funds Really Do book. The books on machine learning were all pretty over my head. I just tried to memorize what I could for the exams but nothing from them ever really clicked.\nOkay, so now the projects. I loved the first few. Project 3 was tough but I put the time in reviewing all the relevant material and got it working. I was so happy that I broke out into an impromptu dance. Project 6 (technical indicators) was also rather time intensive but I enjoyed researching and writing about each indicator.\nSo, I assumed that as long I could invest a large chunk of time into Project 8 that I would get a good grade and be happy with the results. Well, not really. Essentially felt like 2 weeks (80 hours or so?) of trial and error. I really, really wish that they gave some more direction on it. I attended office hours, reviewed the lectures, all the posts on Ed Discussion. It was kind of heartbreaking. I still got a B on the final project but I don't feel like I deserved it considering I failed half the test cases.\nI typically feel that a hard earned B is more valuable than an easy A, but I couldn't tell you what I got out of that final project. I envy the other students who were able to bring all the previous projects together into something that worked in project 8.",

            review: 'For context, my undergraduate background is in STEM with a minor in CS. I paired this course with Deep Learning for the semester and feel like the schedules of these two classes worked together extremely well. There were only two weeks where assignments/quizzes for each class landed on the same week.\nI enjoyed this course, but more for its introduction to finance topics than for any content on machine learning. You definitely get out what you put into this course.\nTA team was excellent. They engaged with the students in the forum quickly and were helpful in answering questions. Sometimes they came off as condescending, but this was in situations of people repeatedly asking the same questions or not taking the time themselves to search the forums.\nOne thing that is important to note is that the exam format of this course has changed, from multiple choice to a multi-select format. This increased the difficulty of the exams slightly from what I had expected based on previous reviews.\nProjects for this course were enjoyable/interesting but tedious, with 25-50% of the time on the project being spent on the actual implementation, and 50-75% of the time being spent on looking through the 10-20 page project writeup and making sure that no points would be deducted for having an incorrectly colored line in a graph or using a list instead of a NumPy array.\nWith so many people taking the course concurrently, it is understandable that they have standardized the assignments to provide quicker turnaround time in grading. While long, the assignment writeups communicate all expectations for the project, its just a matter of tracking down the requirements.\nSubjective Project Difficulty Ranking:\n8 > 3 > 6 > 5 > 1 > 2 > 4\nWould I take this course again? Maybe. I learned a lot about finance in this course but felt like most of the course difficulty came from tedious assignment requirements.',

            review: "My background is EE not CS, and I worked 40-60 hours a week. (generally 40 hours but closer to 60 hours for 1/4 of this semester).  I was familiar with PyCharm, Pandas, and Numpy prior to this course however I would not have called myself an expert (had only used that a handful of times).  I was also a little familiar with basic trading so some of the financial concepts taught were not new to me.  This was my first class at OMSCS.\nClass wasn't difficult per se - if you took notes while watching the lectures carefully, paid attention to the discussions happening on Ed, and reviewed or attended the live weekly sessions, then I think you'll do fine on the exams and quizzes.\nChallenge came from the projects which there were 8 total; some were easy and straightforward but many were time consuming and challenging to implement.   Some projects even build upon previous projects so if you missed something on a previous project, you'll need to go back and fix them.  All very do-able and in my opinion (for the \"harder projects\", there are even recorded lectures on how to think about/implement your project), not impossible to complete successfully for full points.\n25 Hours a week is an estimate - most weeks I'd dedicate 5 hours during the week and around 15 hours on the weekend but there were 2 or 3 weeks where I put around 40 due to projects.  Again, not hard, just time consuming to write and debug all that code.\nLectures are fine and I got by with mostly using them, only touched the textbooks the week of an exam.\nI don't understand the people who complain about the lectures being out dated.  Sure they were recorded a while back but the material in them is still valid.  Reading reviews and posts on Reddit makes me think that people were expecting to be able take the material taught here and immediately be qualified to work as a quant/use your final project to begin day trading.  In one of the weekly discussions early in the semester,, we were told that this course was meant to introduce us to financial concepts and trading, introduce us to ML algorithms, and set us up so we're at a place we can continue our studies if we were interested in learning more.  If you come in with that mindset, you'll see that there is definitely a lot of value to this course.\nFinal Thoughts: Great first class, definitely learned a lot about ML, finance, and even learned a few new things I could do using Python. I wouldn't let any negative reviews discourage you if you're even mildly interested in any of these topics.",

Some of the videos are hour long lectures recorded live several years back. Because the original professor, Dr. Balch, no longer teaches the course, no changes have been made to the curriculum. Having trading lectures from a College of Business professor and ML lectures from a College of Computing professor would dramatically enhance the quality of the lectures. At the moment it is below MOOC quality.\n\n\nReports for programming projects are busy work and should be replaced by a short set of questions about the results that can be answered with a few sentences.\n\n\nThe first assignment, Martingale, is pretty much irrelevant to the rest of the course. Replacing it with a short assignment covering vectorization, Pandas, and NumPy would be much more beneficial to the students.\n\n\nThe Gradescope autograder is not properly utilized by the course. The final submission should run the full suite of tests and actually display the grade for the assignment.\n\n\nThe wording of exam questions is convoluted: sometimes proposing some scenario which requires additional time to parse, flips between positives and negatives (e.g. select all that are not X), and uses terms that were not used in the lectures.\n\n\nAssignment descriptions are extremely long and formatting guidelines (areas for penalization) are scattered throughout. Definitely need to be reworked.\n\n",

However, being completely unfamiliar with Python and its ML-specific libraries, 99% of my time was spent in banging my head over how to transform a numpy array, or how to plot a graph with appropriate legends / axes using mathplotlib (plus the overly detailed and completely meaningless specifications for plotting graphs for each project).\nAnd to top if off, you're expected to present your analysis for each project in the format of a research paper, which again involves so much grunt work.\nIn terms of conceptual learnings, this course is virtually useless. I learnt way more during a 4-week ML concepts seminar at my undergrad than whatever this entire course has to offer.\nSo if you don't know Python based ML, get ready for hours of grunt work that will take up every weekend (almost every week requires a project or assignment to be submitted).\nTotally not worth it if you're planning to specialize in Systems. If you just want to learn ML, I'd rather recommend watching a youtube video series somewhere.",

            review: 'The general perception of this class is fairly accurate, but I think what is not mentioned is how much farther you can take the content if you want to. I didn’t do the readings and got an A. Exams are MC, straightforward, and weighted relatively lightly. I rate difficulty as easy when in reality the difficulty could be harder if you set yourself to a higher standard. The first week or two feels like an introduction to python/pandas/numpy, but after that the class is 50/50 between trading and introductory ML. the TAs (who predominantly run the class) are responsive in forums, provide clarity in office hours, and encourage discussion and deeper analysis whenever possible.\nAs someone who does not want to pursue ML, I took this class because I thought it would be a nice introduction to it (in addition to being interested in investing).\nThe content was really interesting. My biggest gripes were that I do not like writing reports (which is what I spent the most time on) and (and the reason for the lower overall rating) it took a while to get feedback on assignments (this improved after the middle of the semester, but we still waited on ~50% of our total grade until then). Follow up regrade requests also took a while to address.',

            review: "First semester was Spring 2023 in OMSCS program. Was a bit nervous about getting back into school and wanted to take something more mellow. ML4T hit the marks as its using python and of a subject that I'm familiar with already (ML). The class I believe is structured well. The projects are paired with grading scripts which, if you pass all tests, you get full marks on the project. However, there is still the report aspect of it but these are straight forward as well. Ensure that you answer all of the questions or bullets they list for the project and you WILL do well. The hardest part IMO about writing the report was using Professor Joyners document format as I have been use to MLA or APA from previous classes. While I did enjoy this class, I do, looking back now, feel that I slightly wasted one of the classes I could have taken. Not saying that this is a bad class but there are so many great options being offered that I currently can't decide which would be the best to take and already losing out one slot is slightly upsetting when I could take something significantly more interesting or more high-level as ML4T seems to only scrape across the top of each subject. Coming in as a new student, this class is a great choice but looking back now, you could get way more value from other classes.\nForgot to mention, exams are straight forward multiple choice - study the practice questions/exams they give and you'll be fine so long as you do well on those.\n--------Difficulty---------------------\n3/5 - except p3 which is 5/5 and p8 which is just extremely time consuming 4/5\n--------Rating-----------------------\n4/5 -  as a brand new student\n2.5/5 - looking back, kinda wish I took a different course as I didn't learn too much from it",

            review: "Was split between between a 2 and 3 on this. On course content I would give it a 3, or potentially event 4. However, the way this course was run and administered made me want to rip my hair out. This course could be good, but the way it's run is just so frustrating to participate with.\nPros:\n\nOverall pretty mellow in terms of workload and difficulty. Brief hotspots like project 3 and project 8\nExams are very easy. I think you could have never watched a single lecture and probably get a 75%\nProjects are (for the most part) fairly interesting, and good practice of python programming\nLectures are kind of high-level and shallow, but at least mostly interesting\nExposure to basic concepts of finance. May or may not be interesting depending on student interests.\n\nCons:\n\nThe project assignments are these overly pedantic, litigious tomes. They make an Apple Terms of Service contract seem consumer friendly.\nThe TA team has this faux-hyper-positive tone, but are condescending and generally not helpful.\nThere are 8 projects in the course, and we didn't receive a single graded assignment until project 6. Student's are not given a meaningful chance to course correct.\nOn the projects, they levy massive grade penalties over tedious minutia. Meanwhile, some of my writing was absolute garbage, yet somehow scores 100. Basically, the projects largely boil down to an exercise in box-checking by the faculty.\n",

            review: "I took the course in Spring 2023 and ended up getting full marks throughout. Apart from finance, I do not think I learnt much from this course. I did not like the ML part a lot, not because I work in ML, but because I don't think this is a good way to learn ML.\nPros\n\nTAs were super responsive and helpful.\nThe lectures are well-organized.\nGood first course if you have non-CS background.\n\nCons\n\nThe lecture content is slightly outdated. This was my first sem and I was surpised that lectures with errors/mistakes have been used continously since 2017. Atleast add some on-screen info during the lectures.\nBasics ML stuff like cross-validation or out-of sample testing were completely ignored in P8. I would recommend students to do this themselves.\nTA live sessions were unnecessarily long. They were filled with generic and unnecessary remarks, useless boasting from a member of teaching staff about how he would conduct interviews. I would request the TAs to keep TA live sessions short, specially if you refer to it while answering queries. If possible, provide rough timestamps.\nThe same member of the teaching staff (mentioned above) provides generic responses very frequently. Responses like 'do debugging, it helps' are completely useless.\n\nStudents taking this course\n\nRead the assignment wiki, listen to TA sessions and follow Ed regularly. You'll be fine.\nDo practice questions for Exam 1 (30 question pdf) and Exam 2 (100s of questions). Everything is from these.\nDo not limit yourself to what is being taught in the class. If you want to learn more, you can do a lot more than what is required.\n",

I went in expecting the "for trading" aspect to be more of a framing device to learn about machine learning, but a significant portion of the class is dedicated to teaching about stock trading, so don\'t expect an incredibly deep dive into the "ML" part.\nThe majority of projects are very straightforward and some can be done in just a few hours. Most have fairly long reports associated with them, but grading is lenient as long as you make sure to follow the rubric.\nBoth exams are just a couple dozen easy multiple choice questions, but the study material for them is pretty bad -- the practice exams are years old and don\'t cover all the same content as the modern class.',

(In this course, some background in Python, Numpy, Pandas, and/or Matplotlib is recommended though)\nThis was my first course in the program too and was overall a good experience to warm up and adjust to the pace of the program.\nPros:\n\nGreat responsive TAs (Both Ed and Slack, mostly Ed)\nThe assignment schedule for all assignments is released in advance, so you can frontload work if needed, but even otherwise the pace is reasonable for a longer semester (Fall/Spring)\nCan serve as a great warmup for ML (Decision Trees/Q-Learning), also gives a basic intro to some Finance concepts\nEasy exams (both midterm and final), shouldn't require more than 2-3 days of prep each, and easy quizzes\n\nCons:\n\nSlightly dated lecture material (still well organized in Ed lessons)\nAssignment requirements are lengthy and pedantic (As other students said, you know something's off if TAs are asking you to use a highlighter on the grading rubric) and others reported marks being deducted for (minor) issues like printing to the console/plotting windows, on top of which sometimes FAQs are needed to cover up even more details that are unintentionally omitted, which can make the whole experience a bit of a hassle.\nLess learning for people who already have a background in Finance or ML (It touches only the basics of both and not much in-depth)\nProjects 3 and 8 can be big, not due to the complexity/challenge, but due to the sheer number of moving parts needed to complete these assignments (but I guess every course in OMSCS has these), my advice is to start these two as early as possible and not leave it for the last weekend :P\nIt takes a long time for grading and for any feedback on your work (in our case, only 3 batches of grades were released one before the drop deadline, one near the last project's deadline, and one near the end-of-term)\n",

            review: 'At the start of the year, I began my Master’s program at Georgia Tech University. However, in the first semester, I faced various difficulties. Despite this, I managed to perform well (result not out but hopeful). I particularly enjoyed taking ML4T as my first course. I chose it based on reviews from OMSCS Central and my specialization. The registration day was like a quick and exciting flash sale on Amazon, and all seats were booked within a minute.\nML4T is an excellent introductory course for learning about finance and machine learning concepts. Since I already knew these concepts, the course only took about 5–7 hours per week, except for the last few project weeks. I learned how to write Decision Tree and Bag Learners from scratch using numpy, which was a great hands-on experience. The course also covered reinforcement learning and Q-Learning, and I got to create a Q-Learning model from scratch for a trading use case, which was a valuable learning experience.\nBesides machine learning, this course also taught me financial concepts that have made me a better investor. I learned that even choosing a server location can be a significant decision for high-frequency trading companies.\nLearning about amazing financial concepts has certainly improved my investing thought process. Now, I understand the meaning of Alpha, Beta, Sharpe Ratio, and the volatility of a fund. I have learned to evaluate stocks based on fundamental and technical analysis.\nI also learned about the Efficient Frontier portfolio, which is a risk vs return plot that helps identify the best option with minimum risk and maximum return. I have gained knowledge about mean-variance optimization, which involves combining stocks that have anti-correlation in the short term and positive correlation in the long term.\nAdditionally, I received an explanation of options trading and profit and loss plots. I also learned about options strategies like the Covered Call and ButterFly techniques. EMH and CAPM concepts were really valuable.\nIn total, the course consisted of two exams and eight projects. OMSCentral currently rates this course with a difficulty of 2.5 and a workload of approximately 11.2 hours. However, I found that I needed much less time to complete the course, and I generally studied for about 5–7 hours per week. I often completed my work over the weekends. This course does have report writing, so try to be an efficient writer, but reports are not that long.\nOverall, I highly recommend this course as an OMSCS starter.',

The first 7 projects cover a wide range of finance and machine learning topics, with everything magically coming together in the 8th capstone project.\nWhile the workload is not heavy, it is relentless. Taking a week off can create time-management problems. Taking two weeks off can trigger panic! Give up trying to follow the thousands of discussion topics on Ed and instead stay laser-focused on the schedule.",

            review: "I signed up for this class despite reading how unorganized it was because I saw Dr. Joyner's name. Unfortunately, I don't think he got around to giving the Joyner's touch this semester.\nFor example, the final project's description was 25 pages long. There was a 1.5 hour long TA discussion video going over the project. Yet, there're still hundreds of posts asking for clarifications and even after you read through all those posts, you might still have questions.\nFor the first half of the semester, no grades were released till right before the final drop deadline. I'm not sure why they insisted on not releasing any grade. It was very stressful as projects built on previous ones and I would much rather not have a \"W\" on my transcript if I had to drop.\nIf you're planning to take this class, I highly recommend reviewing numpy and pandas as well as read through the posts on the forum. Not all the project requirements are specified on the website; some are hidden in the posts and if you miss it, you miss it. There are also typos and mistakes throughout the lecture videos that won't be clarified unless someone posts about it. Also triple check the scoring guide before submitting. If you draw a black line instead of a red line for the graph, you can lose 10% of your grade.",

There is still a decent amount of work here so if you expect it to be a complete pushover, you will be hurting. Nothing is too difficult and if you follow the instructions its pretty hard to not get an A. If you took RL or ML, I probably would not take this class as the ML techniques taught in this class are pretty basic.\nIf you are interested in the stock market I would recommend it, but if you already know about options and technical analysis I would not take this class, as that's probably most of the value I took away from this class.",

The TA staff are fantastic and ML4T offers a lot of engagement in Ed as well as with the office hours and supplemental material.\nCons:\nI would say the less enjoyable parts of the course were following along some of the videos that are of low video quality or resolution.

I have previous exp. working in python and this was my 2nd class in OMSCS. The time commitment varies per assignment and can be lumpy on a week to week basis. It is possible to speedrun the course, as some folks did in my term.\n(Please note, this class does require a lot of writing. If this is not your preference, it may be less enjoyable in that aspect and require additional effort.)\nHow to do well on exams:\nStudy the sample questions and make sure you can answer them all. They might mention to skip the questions on "The Big Short" movie, as they did in my term.\nHow to do well on projects:\n-Download the project spec\n-Go through every single line in the rubric\n-Double check that you meet each requirement. (You must explicitly answer each line in the rubric!)\n-Sleep on it\n-Repeat this process until you are confident you match all requirements.\n-Post your charts in the charts threads per project and compare against your peers\' to make sure your work is correct',

That being said, it's very doable.\nIntellectually, the concepts are decently challenging at times and will take some time to wrap your head around. Other times, the assignments are intellectually straight forward and you just need to code them (ie. market simulator). For example, creating a decision tree assignment is not a cake walk, but the stringent requirements also are a large contributing factor. You will likely need to actively seek out the material offered in the class, like the extra recitations, etc. and watch lectures again to understand some concepts and get a good start. That being said, it's not insanely impossible to do, you just need butt-in-seat time to get it done.\nThe stringent requirements are really bad though. I spent hours pouring over the details of the requirements and still messed some of them up.\nThe exams are akin to undergrad history or music electives with a CS twist: sit there and ingest a few hundred practice questions until you can regurgitate them onto the test.",

The first seven projects build up to a pretty open-ended Project 8, the capstone, in which we trained a model on real stock data. I feel like building a model to earn money on the stock market is something that most CS people want to do but never get around to actually doing; I found the projects rewarding and I really enjoyed hyperparameter tuning for Project 8.\nThis was not a terribly hard course. The highlight for me was spending so much time learning NumPy and Pandas.\nThe project descriptions are detailed, so the projects can be completed ahead of time.\nProject tips:\n\nMake sure your code compiles without issue in Gradescope, passing all tests.\nBe deliberate about following all instructions.\nDon't spend time staring at a bug; look at Ed forums.\nWatch the TA Live Discussions live or close to live.\nStart the report early because it can take a while to generate visualizations, etc. Definitely not the fun part of the project but very important for your grade.\n\nExam tip: Watch the lecture videos on time or early and take notes. Make sure that you understand all of the concepts on the exam review and you'll do fine.",

            review: "This is a weird course.\nIt's not necessarily difficult in terms of understanding the material, but it's time-consuming and arduous to get all of the deliverables over the line for all of the reasons other students mentioned below. As in, it took me a much longer time to get some of the projects completed than the other two classes I've taken (GIOS and IIS), but I learned significantly less while doing so as most of my focus was on making sure I met the specified rubric rather than re-molding my brain to learn new ideas.\nThe TAs were always responsive, but I never got a helpful answer out of them. For instance, when I asked for clarification on a question on one of the reports, I got the answer: \"Your probability is XXXX, and this is unlikely and too high in Q4. In Q5, your expectation is XXXX, which is also unlikely and too low. I recommend checking your simulation results.\" Asking a student to 'check their results' when they've already submitted a clarification request asking for how they could've thought about the problem differently isn't useful.\nWe get quick grades on the exams, but we have to put in a special request to see which questions we got wrong and we don't get an answer key.\nWe are required to submit multiple reports and projects, with a stretch of a month where we have a project due every single week where all projects build on one another, but we have to wait over a month to get the grades back potentially repeating the same error or assumption across multiple, ungraded projects.\nAll of the assignments are released at the beginning of the semester, so it's possible to get started on any project ahead of time. This is great, except it has the net effect of different tranches of students working on different parts of the course, so the EdStem forum is a mish-mash of questions and, more importantly, students who had got it and turned in their assignments already don't help the other students while they're waiting for the next project. The moving in lockstep goes a long way to helping students feel like they're part of a whole - as it stands now, I felt like I was more alone in this course than others.\nMy goal for the class was to dip my toes into machine learning, and while I did get a reasonably understanding of both Q-learning and decision tree learners, I didn't have any moments in the class where I really had to stretch or get into conversations with fellow students or TAs to struggle to that 'ah-ha!' moment that I did the other courses that I took.\nIt feels like since there's not a professor who has a background in finance that the material has drifted somewhat and the course lacks focus. So as it's gotten stale, the workload has increased by adding busy work that takes a long time and lacks meaningful feedback.\nIn summary, this class isn't difficult in the 'the material kicks your teeth in' kind of way, but it's difficult in the 'make sure you manage your time correctly and be confident that your work is correct' kind of way.\nMy advice for the course at the end of the day was to shunt the busy-work parts of the course to Gradescope, and give immediate feedback for those problems. Ground the students' basics with confidence and then make the programming assignments more difficult to encourage stretching.",

            review: "The lectures are very clear and logically presented, and the content is well explained. The readings are informative as well. You won't need to complete optional readings for the exams and whatnot, but I suggest doing them anyways to get as much out of the course as possible. Otherwise, you may feel like you aren't learning a whole lot in terms of machine learning. The TAs are fantastic. The coding projects range from challenging to easy, and a few are accompanied by papers (no more than 10 pages long). The written, online specifications for the projects are a nightmare, however. They are unnecessarily long, full of repeated instructions, littered with inconsistenties and outdated info. I suggest setting aside 3-4 hourse to go through each one, making your own outline and logging any questions you may have. The study guide for the exams is also WAY outdated and basically useless. Don't use it. Just review the non-optional material you read and heard in lectures, and you will be fine. In summary, this class is GREAT except for the study guides and project instuctions. I would definitely recommend it.",

            review: "Writing this review in the fall with a little more perspective after taking a few more courses. This is a good course with some major drawbacks that could easily be fixed if the staff were interested. I wanted to like the course more than I ultimately did. But it's still run decently (may be a commentary on other courses more than this one).\nPros\n\nTA's are very active. They're responsive on Ed forums and office hours are held multiple times every day. So if you're looking for help, you can get it easily\nCourse is very well taught. Dr. Balch makes the material very easy to understand from lecture videos\nMaterial is interesting and a gentle introduction to ML / AI if you're just getting going to the program\n\nCons\n\n\nProject description pages. Oh my god they're terrible. You'll waste hours deciphering these. I'm halfway through the OMSCS program, and this is the worst I've seen. They feel like they're written by 20 different people, printed out, thrown in the air, then put back in a random order. Sections are repeated but with slight differences that make it difficult to notice / figure out which version is correct. Other parts are repeated verbatim. Certain parts are repeated unnecessarily every project (we get how Gradescope works...don't need a section every time). Certain part are run-on paragraphs rather than bullets which make finding requirements difficult / easy to miss. And API examples might not reflect the requirements of the assignment (different dates, stock symbols, etc.). And in a 6,000+ word document, it's way too long to set students up for success.\n\n\nGrading speed is terrible. With an auto-grader, this is inexcusable\n\n\nPapers. Lots of assignments have a paper alongside them, which is just academia for academia's sake. I didn't get anything from these. Removing these would also improve grading speed.\n\n\nNo feedback on code, so you could \"pass poorly\" and never know\n\n",

I never once spoke with any of them or engaged because right out of the gate they indicated all the ways you could ruin your grade and that if your code fails to run they\'ll just send you a sad face and an F. They also explain that asking about your grade could result in docking more points. I\'m paraphrasing, but they might as well just say "Welcome to the course, we a group of bitter TAs who are tired of grading and hate students" -- the material is interesting, but I was so afraid to talk to them that it took away from my experience. I got a good grade, but sometimes was docked points without understanding why or how to improve (because the feedback is nonexistant) and just kept plowing forward not really understanding the point of the grading process. If given another chance, I would pick different course.\nAlso the video lectures are kinda light and fluffy... so that left me a little disappointed, as someone who would have liked to dive into the math and pseudo code a bit more..

            review: "This is a very interesting course topically that I think has fallen apart as the original instructor has gotten away from the class.\nCourse projects are very time-consuming even though they aren't too difficult. Of the points I lost in this class, they were nearly all due to time constraints on my part rather than an inability to solve the problems. The class has been written to scale and requires interfacing with arbitrary API requirements to receive grades from gradescope that neither reflect real-world software engineering skills nor useful learning. What would take me 15 minutes to scrap together in a jupyter notebook takes me about an hour per their required solutions. There is also a written component to go with these gradescope portions, but all of the dependencies for those reports are required to be submitted in gradescope as well.\nAs others have said, the reports took an extreme amount of time to grade, there was little feedback if any on those, and there was no sharing of exam answers. As just one example, nearly all of the assignments prior to the drop deadline were not graded until only a few days before the drop deadline. You could have gone nearly the whole course making repeated mistakes without any of the instructors so much as giving you a hint. Because of the nature of the class (gradescope heavy) arbitrary mistakes could be costing you multiple letter grades on your assignments.\nOverall, this was not much of a learning experience at all, and I think the course staff should be ashamed of their lack of dedication to the students' learning experience. Learning isn't a one-way street.",

Concepts like mean-variance optimization and Sharpe ratio were enlightening. As was learning about technical trading and different investment strategies.\nThe ML didn't go too deep but was enough to be interesting. We implemented regression trees, bag learners, and Q-Learning. I am taking reinforcement learning this semester, and the first few chapters of reading and the first lectures are very familiar from my experience in ML4T.\nDuring summer the last few weeks were quite busy. We had projects due back-back-back-back, and they were non-trivial.\nMy main complaint for the course is the project requirements were persnickety. You spend a lot of time and energy dealing with annoying requirements that don't facilitate learning, programming principles, or performance, but that help make the class easier to have at scale.\nAverage course. Not really necessary to prepare for ML/RL. Don't regret taking, but also would've perhaps benefited more having taken something else.",

            review: "Machine Learning for Trading was a decent class. It was about the experience I expected, but there's room for improvement. For some background, I have about 5 years of professional programming experience, although most of it has been in test automation and modeling and simulation. The last year I've been working more in AI and autonomous systems, so I wanted to take some classes in ML. I am not all that interested in trading specifically, and I did not expect this course to be too difficult or dive very deep into machine learning, but I thought it might be a good intro to ML.\nThe course was slightly more challenging than I had anticipated, but most of that fell on 2 of the 8 projects, p3 (Assess Learners), and p8 (Strategy Evaluation). Those 2 were the only ones that took more than 6 hours. I have a lot of experience with vectorizing code in Python using Pandas and Numpy, so this course was probably easier for me than most. So It wasn't too bad IMO\nPros:\nI felt like most of the projects had some value. There were a couple I could do without or would rather learn other things, but overall I felt like it was a decent workload and worthwhile projects.\nGrading was pretty generous for the most part. Tests were closed book, closed note, multiple choice. I'm personally not a fan of closed tests like this, and I hate proctoring programs, but the tests weren't bad at all. They were 35 minutes, but I think I finished both in about 25 each. I also didn't do any of the textbook readings, but I did watch all the lectures, and got 23/25 on the midterm and 25/25 on the final. Honestly not sure how I pulled that off on the final but not complaining.\nIf you're interested in trading, there are some interesting concepts here. The actual programming for trading left a bit to be desired, but they were able to give a decent foundation for how it works and some things to look for. However, it was pretty basic, so it was nice for people like me who know nothing about trading, but might be too simple for people who already have an understanding.\nCons:\nI have 3 complaints with this class, the complicated assignment descriptions, the outdated lectures, and lack of breadth in ML concepts.\nExpect to spend 2-3 hours of your time figuring out the assignment and what exactly you're supposed to do. That might be a bit of an exaggeration in some cases, but that is actually how long it took me a couple times. The description itself is an entire essay, and there is still a large FAQ section on Ed Discussions with dozens of students having the same issues. There were multiple times I could tell that other students had the same misunderstandings that I did, but they were afraid to say exactly what the problem was because they were afraid of giving away too much information and violating the honor code or something. This is the worst part of the class is the amount of ambiguity further masked by vague answers on forums from people too afraid they are going to say too much.\nThe lectures are not too bad, but they're several years old now, and have problems. Several of the required videos are recordings from live classes where mistakes are made, have technical issues, and even reveal \"secrets\" for the assignment that are no longer relevant and had to be explicitly mentioned in class forums to ignore them. I would say 60-80% of the lectures are pretty good, but about 10-20% are in desperate need of updates. The rest are kind of in the middle and could be upgraded or not depending on how they decide to handle it.\nLastly, the class teaches basically only 2 ML concepts, decision tree and QLearning. An argument could be made that there are actually 4 concepts, because there are also linear regression/optimization and bag learners, but I don't count the first because that's more of a mathematical optimization than a modern ML technique, and the bag learner is just an extension of the decision tree. I think it would have been better to add in a couple other concepts such as neural nets or Markov models rather than some of the other filler. It would make the class more challenging, but I personally am here to learn, so more experience and little more challenge is worth it to me.\nOverall, it's a good class, but there are better available. It's good as a manageable summer semester or as a starter class, but not something you will get a ton out of. But, if you just need something a little easier, either to take a break or because you don't have the experience yet, I think this is a good one.",

Some of the requirements ask you to include definitions for financial terms and formulas, you need to be careful and cite everything, otherwise, you might be taking a risk of committing plagiarism.\nThere's something due every week if you take it for the summer semester, if you don't figure out how much time each project takes you may get caught off guard and can't finish your assignment in time due to the unstable workload.\n",

            review: "I took this in the summer, which contributed to the difficulty of the course and got an A. With that said though, I kept coming back to the question: \"Why do we take classes?\"\nI think for most people, the number one reason is to learn. Which is why I found this course such a paradox. I learned a ton. My Python skills and understanding of OOP increased, I have a stronger understanding of the random forest algorithm and recursion. I gained experience in reinforcement learning. I learned a lot about the stock market and technical analysis. But I just found the course overall to be a tremendous drag. This is my 9th course in the OMSA program and the only one where I had to force myself to put in the needed time. The class just drained my motivation.\nOthers have spoken about the unneeded complexity of the assignments, and I agree. They were ridiculous at times. The grading is harsh and you can lose a large amount of points for trivial things. Also, the correct answers are never shared.\nThere are two multiple choice tests in addition to the eight assignments. They never reveal to you what you missed on the exams. You are just given a score about a week after taking it.\nThe projects take weeks to get graded and they all build on each other. So if you don't understand something, you're in trouble.\nOne last thing I found annoying is that the lectures were created 5+ years ago. Many of the most important lectures are webcam videos of the previous professor writing on a whiteboard. When those were filmed it was done in conjunction with the live class with the professor answering questions live on Piazza. These need to be redone.\nOne last last thing is the current professor. I admire Dr. Joyner. I have read his Reddit posts and his thoughts on online learning. He clearly cares deeply about this and has done a lot for the OMS programs. However, he does not make a single appearance in this class. Not one. This is a class entirely lead by the TA's (who were pretty good). But I was hoping to have Dr. Joyner make at least one live session or even just a post on Ed.\nSo this class has overall positive reviews, but for me it is not something I would ever want to do again. As I said at the beginning, I learned a lot. But it was a tedious and annoying process instead of the rewarding one I have had in previous classes.",

            review: "I have been working in the investment banking industry for the past 15 years as a quant and therefore I enrolled in the course with a lot of anticipation. While I liked the overall course and the breadth it offers, I was a bit underwhelmed with the learning outcome. Most of the course is dedicated to building the basics of data science and finance and only in the last few weeks do the things get serious. For a graduate level course too much time is spent on things which should be prerequisite. Having said that, I really liked Professor Balch's lecture videos and had more than a few 'aha' moments pertaining to building trading strategies (particularly pertaining to market microstructure/order book and HFT related sections).\nAdvise for prospective students - Start on the final project early as it is worth 20% of the grade. They would dangle the extra credit project just before the final project but that's a bait. It is an addictive assignment where you are trying to beat a baseline trading strategy but coming up with profitable strategy is no joke and takes years of experience. If your strategy does not beat the benchmark in a number of scenarios you will get 0 while wasting valuable time which should have been spent on the final project.",

            review: "I really enjoyed this course. This was my first OMSCS course, and I felt like it was fairly easy (for an MS CS course). I did have a fair amount of self-taught coding experience in Python, which made the projects less time-consuming. Learning NumPy and Pandas up front will really save you time. (I did not have experience with either, so things went slower at times). As someone from a non-finance background, I felt that the content was interesting as well. If you're looking for more challenging content, you know to take the other ML courses or distributed computing or AOP, so don't complain that the course is too easy.\nI get why people are annoyed about the minutiae in the project assignment descriptions. It is annoying for sure. That being said, the annoyingly detailed and lengthy instructions are, I believe, a decent way to make the course scalable, while keeping our tuition accessible. First, it is an attempt to force the hordes of ignorant students that don't ever read the instructions and ask ridiculous questions in the discussion forums to not do ridiculous things on their assignments. I'm sure that if they didn't put heavy penalties on certain requirements (e.g. not printing things to the console or not generating charts live), students would repeatedly ignore instructions and make things unnecessarily difficult for the TAs. It also makes the grading easier. TAs don't have to read our work as carefully- they basically just go through the rubric and check off things to make sure we've included them in our work.\nIn an ideal world, the TAs would look over our work more carefully and give us feedback on the merits of our work rather than by a contrived rubric, but that would drive up the cost of tuition.\nOn the upside, if you do spend the time to follow the instructions to a T, you're pretty much guaranteed a good grade. There's no guessing as to whether a TA will give you a good or bad grade based on a whim. Just follow the instructions/rubrics, make sure you've hit everything, and you should be good to go.",

            review: 'Honestly this class took me more time than I was expecting. While I would not say that this is a difficult class, I would caution anyone taking it that it can be a time-consuming class. At the end of the semester, I have this nagging feeling that I really did not learn that much considering the time I put into the course. You could make the argument you get what you put into it.. but if that were the case I would say take a better organized class and you can gain all of the learning you would from this class from self study without the headache of parsing these assignments. Assignments can arbitrarily difficult and force you to spend hours understanding assignments and making sure you follow all criteria. In my experience the time spent on these assignments was not worth the actual knowledge I gained from completing them. In addition, the time each assignment takes can vary extensively. I finished the first two assignments in about 4-8 hours while I was blindsided on assignment 3 and spent around 15-20 hours. Then came assignment 4 and I finished it in 30 minutes. I would definitely recommend reviewing the assignment ahead of time to judge the time it will take you and not use the past assignments as a measure. This is a pain when assignment requirements are 20+ pages it feels like with requirements hidden throughout. My other complaint around assignments is that the grading is slow and so there is no real feedback loop to help you improve on future assignments.\nConceptually I will say that I liked the flow of this class. You start with building some algorithms and a tool to simulate a trading environment. At the end of the semester, you take all of the pieces you have built throughout the semester and make them all work together. It was pretty satisfying at the end to test my different strategies and see the puzzle come together.\nI will most likely end the course with an A at this point unless I get blindsided by missing some requirement on the final project. I have decent python experience and did all of the assignments without attending a single office hour so I cannot speak to their value. I have seen several reviews speak to their quality so that is probably on me and could have influenced my overall score. Just keep that in mind that you budget yourself enough time when scheduling this course to attend those in addition to the assignments and any other coursework. The tests are fair for the most part and probably only require an evening of studying where you watch through the lecture videos. The questions were straightforward and similar to the practice problems they provide. The majority of the time in this class will be spent on the assignments which vary in length from 1-3 weeks. In the end, I am neutral on the quality of this course. The projects are fairly interesting after all the unnecessary fluff. I put 12 as the estimated hours it took me but in reality there were some weeks where I spent 20 hours and some weeks where I spent 1. Just give yourself some cushion on the assignments and you will probably make it through the course much more painlessly than I did.',

They don't even care to re-record this.\nI still don't know how Mr. Joyner related to this course, if you put your name on it please at least give an effort to make it yourself, so when you force absurd JDF format at least we would know you changed a thing or two.\nAlthough I respect Mr. Balch way before this course, let's be realistic, if you don't know what the heck is Numpy at the beginning, there is no way you can code Q-learner at the end in a dynamic fashion.\nThis weird course thinks that during one single semester they can take you from\nNumpy illeterate -> Dynamic Programmer -> Decision Tree Coder -> Re-inforcement Learning Application Writer\nand apply this to the stock market. This is when the Bull market takes a break for #2.\nYou don't need to watch lectures at all, check the names of the lectures, and watch the ones right before small in-class mini-quizzes. Make sure you read the project instructions really carefully and spend some time on reports, they try to butcher every single thing on the reports, like that means anything in applied coursework.\nSometimes, the little bugs you will get are like, using random package instead of np.random, if you do you get a timeout. What a genius teaching example.\nStart the last project early, requirements are all over the place, lots of stuff is being asked and there is a report.\nInstead of lectures, you will be watching lots of Tucker Balch youtube videos explaining projects, where most of the learning happens.\nI spent 20 hours on Friday and Saturday doing the projects, didn't attend or watched any TA sessions, and watched the lectures only before exams. I'll probably get a B since I don't care about the reports.",

            review: "Pretty awful in terms of project requirements and the projects themselves. The lectures are actually one of the better lectures I've seen in OMSCS, because they are pretty short and to the point. The interactions on Ed Discussion with course management saves this class from being totally miserable.\nWhere this class falls short\n\nthe list of project requirements is absurdly long and complicated to parse. The instructors recommend you print out the requirements and highlight them. If you're recommending that, you know something as gone awry.\ngrading feedback is close to useless. if you do poorly, you won't know why. if you do well...you won't know why either but you'll probably care less\nReliance on TA interactions and other confused classmates on Ed Discussions to translate the mess of the project spec into readable language (though again, the TAs were helpful in my semester)\nJumps around too quickly without any sort of real depth. Expect to be introduced to various terms, but don't expect to truly understand what they mean.\nUses non-standard terms when referring to established concepts in ML\nhaving too many different places to receive information. why is there an external lucylabs.gatech.edu website?? Just roll it into Canvas.\n\ntldr of this course: believe the other reviews that this course is fairly straightforward and trivial, and that parsing projects is such an arduous and draining process. I thought the reviews were exaggerating, but they aren't. Even the reviews that say they liked the course admit they spend hours parsing project documentation, and I can't fathom how you can reconcile that with enjoying the course.",

            review: 'I really wanted the course to be better than it was. I have a finance/data modeling background and am a little newer to pure CS. I think the content covered is really great and provides a good intro into ML. The finance stuff is on the very basic side of things.\nThe reason why I disliked/strongly disliked this course is the grading system is absolutely ridiculous. It is really like they are looking for pointless reasons to take points away which shifts the focus from learning how to implement a decision tree from scratch lets say, to spending an absurd amount of time looking through the project wiki to see if you are meeting all the arbitrary requirements. Oh the TA didn’t like your chart title? -10 points. Oh the TA for some reason felt your chart didn’t save as a .png even though it clearly does and is a clear simple oversight? -10 point and wait until the end of the semester for a regrade, where if we are generous enough to look at the project again we might credit you the points we decided to take away from you. Oh didn’t implement this function without solely using NumPy in under 20 lines. -20 points. For reference while I haven’t yet and don’t want to explicitly jinx myself here, I am very likely going to earn an A, there is however an inappropriate amount of points removed for mundane requirements that really have nothing to do with ML or Finance and the intersection thereof. Additionally for reference, the projects are worth 100 points so yes, if you don\'t use the appropriate title or your legend is wrong or your axis is wrong you will lose 10% of your total grade which is composed of a project that takes roughly 10-15 hours to code give or take your experience level and a 5 page paper for almost all of these projects. But you are right grading system, my axis label is 10% of that effort...\nOne other thing to be stated is the TAs response in the discussion board is very hit or miss. I felt most really avoided answering a lot of questions directly and just referenced you to material in some snarky/"If you watched the material..." kinda way, when in fact the material that you watched was exactly what your question was about, just belittles the student asking the question and in the same time you wrote out some misplaced scolding response you could have just answered the question directly was a very common occurance. This personally never happened to me, but it was pretty clear to see the frustration from students asking questions in the discussion board on some topics and coming away almost being scolded for asking the question in the first place. Like dude, this is a learning environment, and as a TA is it a kinda sorta like your whole job to answer a question a student has asked explicity on learning material that, at this point is 7 years old, is posted online...\nAlso writing papers are not ideal to me in a CS program but I do understand the minimal value there because this is grad school.\nThat being said, I do actually recommend this class if you are REALLY interested in ML and Finance, I think it can spark a few really cool ideas, just be ready to deal with some pedantic grading which seems to way over penalize for arbitrary requirements',

            review: 'This subject is something I have a strong interest in. I work at a financial company and read books about finance for fun. I write code at work and loved the Computing for Data Analytics course I took at the start of the program where I scored 100%. So this isn\'t a case where I\'m someone who didn\'t understand the material or take the prerequisites. I did want a lighter course load this semester, so perhaps my mistake was trusting the relatively decent reviews and low reported workload when I signed up for ML4T for Spring 2022.\nInitially there was a lot to like. The instructional staff went to great lengths to communicate and help and encourage students to get their environments set up early. This is often a problem in an educational environment so I took that as a good sign that they took the problem seriously. The early lecture videos are a little goofier than I really want and a bit dated, as is the Python book that is recommended, but they got the job done and in spite of being a bit slow you can turn up the speed.\nBut things started to go poorly from there. An overarching theme for this course is the instructions and written guidance for the course are spread out all over the place which makes for a really annoying experience of trying to figure out what you are supposed to do and when and how. In general this class feels much more adversarial than any other class I\'ve taken in this program and I don\'t know why it is set up this way.\nA basic thing that caught me up early on was the "content quizzes". These are not listed on the weekly syllabus on the main class website. All other content is there or on the Ed platform. Canvas does get used to submit your code and written reports for projects (homework). The official policy is you won\'t get a grade for anything until the end of the course but they might release them earlier when they feel like it. So generally speaking you won\'t be looking at Canvas since there isn\'t really any reason to look at it most of the time. However, this was the only place where it seemed to mention these content quizzes and when they were due. So I kept not seeing that and missing points just because they weren\'t on the syllabus or anywhere else you are encouraged to look.\nOne formerly required project is now marked as optional. Try not doing it however. You will need it in order to do one of the early projects. If you ask for help on the required project the first thing the TAs will ask is if you have done the optional project and continue to nudge you in that direction. Make the project required! You do actually have to do the project to get the results you need for the other actually required project, because the tests are absurdly fussy about how precise your result is and if you do the order of operations differently you will be "wrong". I\'m trying to keep my workload light this semester so I was treating optional things as just that, optional, and instead had to go back and do this "optional" assignment in order to complete the required one.\nProject 3 "Assess Learners" is incredibly difficult and time consuming. You are given an extra week to do it at least. They do warn you and advise you to use all of your time for this project and it is a significant part of your grade, and yet, I am still going to complain about this. After the first two required projects and one "optional" project, I had the wrong idea about how easy this course was going to be and I did not allocate the full two weeks to Project 3 because I had been able to do the other ones easily. I started earlier than I had for the other ones and it still wasn\'t enough. The difficulty spike between this and everything you have done before this is massive and it should be broken up into different projects.\nThe project requirements are poorly written and this gets mentioned a lot by other reviews. But yes, they are bad and one of the more significant challenges in the course. They do read as if they have been substantially edited in places at different times by different people so at least they have made some effort to improve them but someone probably needs to write the whole document from scratch instead to bring some sanity to the requirements. The point deductions are very large given the known problems with the requirements.\nThey are extremely slow to return grades and when they do the feedback is cryptic. So in addition to instructions being a mess, when you get a grade you will get deductions which tell you very little if anything about what mistake you actually made. No solutions are posted, ever. Good luck learning! Do it correctly the first time or else because each project builds to the next one so any failures on your part are going to be magnified throughout the course with no guidance on how to correct the mistake. Also they will intentionally insert bugs in some projects and not tell you about them so you have to question whether you set up your environment incorrectly or any of a million other things. Thankfully they at least admitted they had done that when I searched for that error message in the Ed forums but there was no reason to add this hurdle in the first place and definitely no reason to hide that they had done it.\nMany of these problems are known and acknowledged by TAs. They will even "helpfully" tell you that you should PRINT the instructions and use a highlighter so as not to be hit with substantial point deductions. If everyone knows the instructions are this badly written, then the burden should be on the instructors and TAs to improve them rather than tell students to deal with it. This is "machine learning for trading", not "reading poorly written requirements docs for software development". The latter can be a useful skill in the real world but there is no reason for this pointless extra difficulty to be added.\nIn addition, based on responses from instructors and TAs, it seems that most of this pointless added difficulty is intentional and added mainly for the sake of making it harder for students to cheat. I understand the motivation. No one wants anyone to cheat or to make it easy to do so. But making it harder to cheat also makes it significantly harder to learn. As with other elements of the course, the onus is on the student when the responsibility should lie with the instructor. Write clear instructions. Create tests and projects and homework such that a student won\'t be able to get a good grade by cheating (I say this having taken Computing for Data Analytics which manages this superbly) rather than opting for "security by obscurity" which is a poor model of security and in this case runs extremely counter to the primary goal of education.\nI don\'t understand why the class is run this way. There is good content here and it\'s something I really enjoy normally but all of this extra arbitrary and capricious difficulty inserted throughout the course makes it extremely unpleasant. Most of the materials are available for "free" via the class website so I would recommend people just look at in on their own rather than try running this cruel gauntlet. I don\'t see any reason to pay even the low costs of this program for this class when there doesn\'t seem to be much focus on actually teaching the material to the students.',

            review: "This was a great class - so far one of my favorites, 6 classes in the program. It is amazingly well-structured and the lectures were excellent. I think this is a great class for someone not in the ML specialization because you will learn a lot about ML and walk-away with a big picture understanding. Other courses like AI and ML are also good, but very rigorous for an elective - why put yourself through that? If you are in the ML specialty, then ML4T can serve as a gentle introduction before jumping into the more rigorous and time-consuming courses like AI, ML, etc.\nThe course was structured with  approx. the first 25% of the class being mostly about python and the pandas library. (i.e. Dataframes and ndarrays). The first couple labs get you use to writing python code and are actually kind of difficult - not extraordinarily hard, but don't totally underestimate them. Then the class moves into machine learning and uses finance and the stock market as a way to apply ML techniques. One of the labs involves a decision tree - I think this is lab #3. This is maybe the hardest lab of them all because it requires recursion and implementing the ID3 algorithm. I think this throws a lot of students, but if you can get over this then the rest of the course is a breeze. The midterms are straightforward - they give you sample questions and that is all you really need plus watching the lectures. The text is Tom Mitchell's Machine Learning. I do not really think you need it. I got it and read a few chapters, but it was very theoretical and I do not think you need it to do well in the class.\nThe machine learning structure was broken down into Supervised Learning,Reinforcement Learning and you are introduced to other topics like Unsupervised Learning, Neural Nets, Simulation, Optimization, and lots of Finance/Stock Market concepts.\nAssignment 1 (martingale) was an intro to Simulation\nAssignment 2 Optimize Something introduced a little Optimization Theory\nAssignment 3 Supervised Learning via decision trees\nAssignment 4 Contrasts Classification (Decision Tree) with Regression\nAssignment 5 and 6 are really just preperations for the largest Assignment #8. You will use them to complete 8.\nAssignment 7 is Reinforcement Learning using QLearning\nAssignment 8 - the mother of all the projects....brings it all together. You use everything you learn to beat the stock market.\nExtra Credit - I skipped it and didn't really need it. I used the time to focus on project #8.\nThe workload was uneven with some weeks requiring a lot of time and other weeks it felt like there was nothing to do. The course feels like it is front-loaded and back-loaded with a soft middle in terms of commitment. Assignment 8 was the most time consuming. Assignment 3 was the most challenging. Assignment #7 was the next in difficulty. and then the rest are about the same. They had weekly online meetings to go over the assignment, but it felt like they just read the assignment to you and added very little. I found little value in these meetings and stopped attending after the second one.\nThe best thing about the course were the excellent TAs and instructional staff. Use the Ed Discussions - there were questions that I asked and the responses felt like I was reading towardsdatascience or medium. The depth of some of the instructors were amazing and they were incredibly responsive. I was really impressed with Barbara and Steven (or Stephen) but the instructional staff and TAs were awesome across the board.\nOverall a great class, you will learn a lot, the TAs and Staff were very knowledgeable, and instructional material was well-organized and excellent. If you want a mid-level difficulty course in python and machine learning, this is a good place to start.",

            review: "I thought I would throw a review into the ring for any OMSA students looking to take this course. My background is mechanical engineering and not software engineering. I only picked up python in the last 18 months as part of the OMSA program.\nGiven my light experience level, I did find the third project and final project to be more difficult, but manageable by spreading out the workload over the full duration of the assignment. The third project likely took me 20 hours per week and the final project was similar in time commitment for those three weeks (70/30 coding to reporting split). The final project documentation provided by the instruction team is a bit too extensive and makes actually interpreting requirements somewhat difficult. I had coded the entire project twice only to read a single sentence buried among 15 pages of documentation that changed how my implementation had to be done (adding more time). Note, that all the other projects could typically be knocked out in a weekend or between a couple light weekends of work.\nThe TAs are tremendous and Ed Discussions help answer many questions you will have as you go through assignments. The auto-grading is actually something I liked and if it passes the auto-grader at submission, it is fair to assume you will receive mostly full marks.\nThe exams are great, in that they are quite easy. As someone with a background in trading, most concepts were already well understood and I did not have to spend more than a couple hours reviewing content. However, if you just review the assigned lecture material and read the book authored by Balch, then you are guaranteed to fair well on the exams.\nSo, in the end, if you are an OMSA student with decent python programming skills, then there is no need to be concerned with taking this course - just make sure to chip away at assignments over a couple week period and don't wait until the last minute for anything.",

            review: "I don't really understand the criticism of this class. It explains the basics of machine learning for trading. I think I learned quite a lot from it, video lectures explain concepts pretty well. Assignments are well designed. The only issue I had with this class is that not all tests are available on the gradescope, so basically your grade usually consists of a coding section and a report. I believe if all tests will be automated and available through the gradescope it could help building the confidence in the expected grade.",

You have to pay great attention to details to avoid losing points.\nOverall, a good intro-level course for finance, Python, and machine learning concepts. As someone who does not have much experience in Python, I manage to get full scores for all projects.',

            review: "Summary\nWhat this class is\nOverall, this class follows what a lot of the other reviews have stated. The lectures and material are not too complicated so that a data science wizard can breeze through or a non-CS major can learn it with a little bit of effort. The lectures, readings, and assignments build upon one another and this continuity was refreshing compared to other classes. The exams are easy if you study the lectures and readings for 5 hours (assuming you reviewed them throughout the class originally). Every assignment has a video or example that you can follow along to get an idea of how to do it. Assignments are not open ended, which is great for an intro to ML concepts. The python programming required is all numpy, and pandas-based. Review numpy and pandas prior to the course. The project descriptions are not as fleshed out as they should be, so fulfilling the requirements can be time consuming and annoying. However, with a little bit of effort on reading the project descriptions and watching the videos anyone can get an A.\nWhat this class is NOT\nThis class is not an in-depth review of a vast amount of industry ML concepts that can be used as a foundation for other classes such as ML or DL. The ML concepts lack breadth and aren't too difficult conceptually. However, this makes it a great intro ML course. This class is not a all-inclusive financial concepts course that can teach you all the concepts a CS person who wants to trade will need to know.\nMy Review (Overall Grade: 95%)\nBackground\nUndergrad CS-major with some experience in python. I did not have experience in numpy and pandas which is essential to this course. I understood some of the basic financial concepts from, you guessed it, losing money in the stonk market.\nOverview\nHere is a link to the syllabus: http://lucylabs.gatech.edu/ml4t/fall2021/\nI meticulously tracked my time spent on this course and each individual project throughout the semester using a tracking app. The times stated are extremely accurate.\nTotal Hours spent on this course: 119 hours and 20 minutes\nAverage hours per week: 7.5 hours\nMax hours spent in a week: 24 hours 26 minutes (project 8, the Capstone)\nMin hours spent in a week: 0 hours\nLectures/Readings\nThe video lectures range from the ML4T Udacity lectures to Professor Balch's YouTube channel. The lectures introduce the concepts needed for the projects and explain them very well, anyone can understand. The lectures also give tips for doing the projects, so please watch them before attempting projects.\nThe readings are mainly needed for the exams.\nProject 1 (8 hours 40 minutes, Grade: 94%)\nThis project was a good introduction to using statistics, rudimentary math, python, and writing a report to JDF specification. You'll notice that time spent on projects directly correlates to whether a report is needed. This project gently introduces the expectations for the course in regards to coding using numpy, statistical understanding, and report writing.\nProject 2 (4 hours 54 minutes, Grade: 100%)\nThis is a more coding-heavy project. You'll use the python library scipy to optimize a financial indicator for a given stock portfolio and generate a chart. This chart is the only \"report\" to be turned in.\nProject 3 (14 hours 12 minutes, Grade 76%)\nThis project is extremely important, and in my opinion the most difficult one. It is using ML concepts to create a learner that is then used in the capstone project. Make sure to get this one right and understand all the concepts, as they will come back to you in Project 8. Very python heavy, and a large report of your experiments is required. I lost points for using a python list variable instead of a numpy ndarray. Don't be like me and lose 20 points on a one-line mistake.\nProject 4 (4 hours 43 minutes, Grade 100%)\nNo report required. This project can either take 1 hour or 10 hours. This kind of depends on ingenuity. It was a project to create datasets to be used for different learners. If you understand linear regression and decision trees it won't take more than 5 hours.\nProject 5 (14 hours 52 minutes, Grade 100%)\nNo report required. This project took me a long time due to bugs in my code. My best recommendation is to watch and re-watch Professor Balch's video on the project. Your project will take stock trade orders and cross-reference the orders with the stocks' prices for that day to generate portfolio values per day. Python numpy and pandas experience is very helpful here.\nProject 6 (10 hours 41 minutes, Grade 100%)\nIn this project you select technical indicators for stocks and write code to generate them from given stock data. A report also goes with this describing the indicators. Make sure to read the project description very carefully, as you are stuck using these in Project 8.\nProject 7 (5 hours 24 minutes, Grade 102%)\nThis project uses Q learning. You write some python to make a Q-learner that passes some tests. No report required! I highly recommend watching the videos on Q-learning and Dyna-Q prior to starting.\nProject 8 (26 hours 10 minutes, Grade 100%)\nThis project is the capstone. You will take your indicators from project 6, and the learners from project 3, and your market simulator from project 5, and put it all together. You create strategies for trading stocks based on your ML concepts learned in the course, do some experiments, and write a report about it. It's very time consuming and requires looking at discussion posts and the project description to not mess anything up. Good luck.\nExams\nExam 1: 93.3%\nExam 2: 96.6%\nIf you watch the required videos and do the readings throughout the course, these exams take only 5 hours of review to get an A. The questions aren't hard and come directly from the material.",

            review: 'All the reviews in the forum are pretty accurate depending on your background. I had a robust programming background and was familiar with the economic terms due to crypto trading, but I had no idea about machine learning.\nThe 1st part (introduction to pandas dataframes) was easy to follow even for people without strong programming background.\nThe 2nd part was easy to digest from the videos. If you have done some\ntrading in your life you will know a lot of those stuff. Anyway the videos are great.\nThe 3rd part is the machine learning stuff. It is the "hardest" part of the course but no big deal. All you will need is inside the videos.\nThe project are interesting and fun. Some of them may require more time than others. Be sure that you READ THE INSTRUCTIONS CAREFULLY AND WATCH PROFESSORS BALCH PROJECT VIDEOS and you will have no problem. The writeups are a little bit boring. Exams are easy. I studied 5 hours each and scored 92% & 100%.\nTo wrap up, it is an easy and intresting course. You will learn stuff about stocks, about trading & about machine learning. The learning depth is "not great, not terrible". There were weeks that kept me engaged for 15hrs and weeks that I did absolutely nothing. You can front load the course and be relaxed in the last month. Easy A for me',

            review: "This was my first class in the program. I learned A LOT!\nRead the project description at least 5x or you'll lose points. Use the exam questions published by the TAs for exam #1 and student questions for exam #2. The student questions are not all correct but are still a great resource, especially if you ask questions before the quiet period. I don't know why everyone complained about it. The exams were also very fair.\nWatch the lectures before you start the project because everything is there. If you're someone who doesn't like lecture and skips straight to the project, good luck!\nDevelop your own tests for projects because not all unit tests are released for testing, some are hidden tests exclusive to grading.\nI personally flailed on project #6 because I had a hard time choosing indicators.\nIdeally, learn vectorization with numpy and practice recursion before coming into class. Matplotlib experience is nice too.\nRun the local grader as soon as you can to get feedback. It's the best measure for where you're at, even if it gives you an error.\nThe end of the class is quite peaceful. P8 was due 11/28 and exam #2 was not cumulative and exclusive to the last half of the class.\nStart P3 EARLY!!!!!\nDon't fret so much over JDF, follow it to the best of your ability. They just want readable and reasonable papers. They aren't busting out a ruler to measure your indentations or taking points off for improper bolding/italics.",

            review: "Coming from a non-CS background (Mechanical engineer), this \"easy\" class wasn't as easy as I thought, but was very rewarding!\nBefore starting the course, I audited Georgia Tech's Computing in Python 1 on edX. That taught me enough to do the first assignment.\nWhen I saw that the remaining assignments look completely foreign to me, I thought I was out of luck. But the professor's lectures were very helpful and somehow I managed an A in this course. My interest in finance and stocks helped me stay motivated throughout this course and helped me acquire the required CS skills.\nIf you are coming from a non-CS background, this is a good and rewarding class to start with. That does not mean that it is an easy class.\nIf you are interested in finance but do not know much, this class will be low-level enough that you will be able to learn a lot and practice it out too!\nIf you are interested in machine learning but do not know much about it, this class will be a good introduction.\nIn conclusion - 10/10 class, would recommend for:\n(i) People without a strong CS background (but interested in learning),\n(ii) People without a strong financial background (but interested in learning), and/or\n(iii) People without a strong ML background (but interested in learning!).",

            review: 'The Good, The Bad and The Ugly\nThe Good\n\nProfessor Balch comes across as humorous, friendly and experienced.\nInstructor Joyner comes across as a compassionate administrator.\nThe TAs respond quickly to questions and post useful FAQs.\nThe python environment and grading scripts make environment setup easy and provide a useful way to test code.\nGentle intro to finance for those who find it boring.\nGentle intro to machine learning for those who find it intimidating.\nRegrading seems to work; processes in general are setup to support anomalies.\nProviding options for people that want to use real academic writing tools as opposed to MS Word.\nAllowed to post your graphs to get student and TA feedback.\nLinux support. Linux is where it\'s at for ML in particular. Class is almost 100% compatible with the exception of HonorLock, which is an abomination.\n\nThe Bad\n\nRudimentary: minimal rigor:\nHigh school level math.\nBasic ML algorithms.\nIntro-level programming techniques.\nAnachronistic: the material feels dated and disjointed at times, and doesn\'t flow well.\nSections are done out of order, and the readings do not always align (EMH lecture is presented in Part I, but the reading section is in Part II, etc).\nLectures have a low signal to noise ratio, and aren\'t accompanied by slides, so you have to watch them at 2x speed.\nGrading is extremely slow at times, this is insidious because the projects build on one another, so not knowing if you did a preceding project correctly can cause a lot of anxiety starting the next one.\nToo many channels. Is this on the project FAQ? YouTube? Lectures? Announcement? Project Wiki? Or a combination of all, and you have to read the tea leaves?\nComplexity varies from a week of "intro to python" material (.e.g a = 1) to a detailed demo of vectorization.\n\nThe Ugly\n\nMost of your time will be spent chasing clarity and expectations on assignments. Jumping from wiki to post, parsing announcements, then possibly posting a question, only to be told to go back and read the assignment (sometimes a section will be quoted). No exaggeration: this is what you\'ll do in the class, not thinking about ML or trading, but try to find out if you need to add a 3rd graph to a report because in one section it alludes to a 3rd graph.\nA good remainder of your time will be tweaking graph sizes and editing wording so that you get full credit within the arbitrary length limit set for the report.  An example might be "describe in detail why your model overfits", although over-fitting is explored minimally in the context of the assignment, and no hints are given if you ask what does "in detail" mean.  This becomes a constraint optimization problem, where you need to fit the most meaning into the fewest words.  There\'s no buffer - if you spill over past the page limit, results are ignored.\nNot enough feedback.  The penalty is extremely high for doing something minor like forgetting to add a function that returns your GT user name.  The feedback loops are too long.  This is anxiety-inducing.\n\nConclusion\nThe class feels like "manufactured complexity", whereby the material is kept basic, and then hoops are introduced to jump through to add complexity and difficulty in order to simulate rigor. The retort to this charge is usually something like "in the realworld..." or "this is how graduate school is..." it\'s not.\nThis Class Could be Great\n\nClean up the section numbers so that lessons are in order.\nFix the readings so that they align with the lessons.\nEdit videos so invalid content is just removed.\nOverhaul the videos so that there is higher signal-to-noise ratio.\nProvide an accompanying outline for all videos for consistency.\nAbolish simulated rigor:\n** Clean up assignment descriptions so that the checklist and rubric are accurate and one in the same.\nProvide a checklist instead of having the students create their own.\n35 minutes for 30 questions doesn\'t give enough time for thinking, get rid of the "what color shirt did Michael Burry wear in the first scene" questions and replace them with questions that require thought.\nGet rid of the HonorLock restrictions for scratch paper and ask some calculation questions.  Or be bold enough to state that there will be no math questions.\nFix the paper chase: if students are spending the majority of their time cross-referencing your educational material, it needs an overhaul.\nIntroduce real rigor.\nWe shouldn\'t be focusing on in-sample results.  That\'s an anti-pattern in ML.\nWe should be splitting data into train/validation/test splits, or using k-folds validation or similar techniques.\nEliminate the baby stuff - there are prerequisites for a reason.\nAdd more quizzes so that there\'s a tighter feedback loop.\nEnhance the grading process so that grades are returned sooner than months.\n\n[EDIT: fixed a few typos and formatting - this tool could use a preview option.]',

The assignments include a coding portion and mostly accompanied by a report. Assignment descriptions can be quite wordy and it might take some effort to identify what actually needs to submitted. Overall effort that needs to be put strongly depends on familiarity with Python, numpy, pandas and matplotlib.

The fact that they budget some of the course time and material to help you level up in those areas shows that the professor cares more than most - he doesn't just throw projects at you and says to \"self-learn\" the material; rather, he actually uses the course to help teach you some of the things you'll need to know in order to succeed. I wish more professors did this.\nAs a negative - the assignment documents need improvement. They do contain everything you need to know in order to not lose points, but they're also overly verbose or not as well organized as they could be. This is something I noticed other reviewers points out too. To mitigate this, some classmates copied the requirements into word documents to help track which requirements have or haven't been met. I eventually came around to following that advice on the last 3 assignments and think it definitely helped.",

            review: "I like the subject and material, but I did not like the delivery. The instructions for each project are 5+ pages long. Instructions are poorly organized and it feels like a puzzle game. For example, suppose you need to submit 1 report and 5 python files. The requirements for the each of these files are spread throughout the 5 pages. So you literally have to hunt down each component and collect all the different requirements in the 5 page instruction and figure out all the tiny little details to get things correct.\nAnother practice I don't like about the course is that they don't tell you what is the correct solution to the things you did wrong. Let's go back to the basic definition of a class. Students learn in class. The reason why I am doing the masters course is to learn. The reason why I pay for a class in an education institution is for the feedback and help on materials I didn't do well on.\nGrading is also sloppy and disproportionate. If you go through the rubric of the deductions, they add up to be over than what the section is worth. Let's take project 6 for example. The report is out of 100 points. It doesn't specify what each component is worth, but it specifies what will be deducted. Can you see how quickly this will become disproportionate?\nFor example, it says the Theoretically Optimal section maximum deduction is 20 points. So that means the other section combined should be 80 points.\nGrading rubric for this 20 point section is as follows.\n\n-10 if the method desribed is not correct or convincing\n-10 If the chart is not correct\n-5 if the benchmark is not normalized or not in green and nother\n-5 if the portfolio line is not correct or in red.\n-2 for each item if the reported performance criteria are incorrect\n\nThe points tallied up to 32+ point deductions while this section is worth 20 points. This part does not make sense to me.\nAlso, I did well in this course, but still don't like the delivery.",

            review: "The amount of python knowledge you need to know to get through this is nuts to me. You pick it up though because you have to. You're going to get really comfortable with numpy and pandas in this course. Some of the projects felt like I was dying because they took forever and then the report on top of it with a bazillion requirements also took forever. You have to really watch for the percentages of how much each project is worth. If you bomb one of your projects, you essentially take a major hit to your grade if it's worth a large percentage, especially near the end when the last project is worth 20% of your grade. I'm probably going to get a C at this point, had an A up until the last project.\nThe midterm wasn't bad, just there's a lot of material. Similarly, there's a lot of material for the final but it's post midterm content. Sitting here studying for the final knowing my fate is pretty much sealed to a C. It was my first exposure to ML (also RL) and you have to watch The Big Short, lol. Anyways, it's definitely made me rethink whether I wanted to do machine learning or not, and I think machine learning is definitely more data science related, which I'm not interested in I've come to find. You spend a lot of time pouring over stock information trying to create trading strategies with policies and at the end of the day if you keep up with the readings, technical analysis (which is pretty much what we're doing the entire course) is essentially pointless. I think you could get by with a more relevant application than trading or just go ahead and take the regular ML course instead of this one.\nA few takeaways:  1. You'll definitely be a lot more proficient at Python. 2. You probably won't use any of this after you walk out of the class. Food for thought. Plenty of people in the class have tried to take what we've learned and ended up doing worse (you can also waste your time trying to develop something like that for extra credit for the class but if it ends up doing badly you get zero credit for it, lol).\n\n\n\nInformation Ratio = Information Coefficient * Sqrt(Number of Trading Opportunities)\nPerformance = Skill * Sqrt(Number of Trading Opportunities)\nThis shit is fundamental to the class...and also wrong in practice.\n\nTAs are extremely slow getting your grades back to you. It'll be nail-biting around drop date to know if you should stick it out.\nYou can get f'd at the end, not knowing what your grade is on P8 if it wasn't released since you'll take your final likely before you get a grade back on that, unless you're told in advance.\nLectures are outdated and some of the Balch YouTube livestreams were misery to watch. However, it's pretty heavily technical, so bear that in mind when you're trying to digest the course material.\nQuestion banks for the midterm and final exams are enormous, sometimes inaccurate, and you just have to do your best to get through it.\nReports take a long time because they're so nit-picky and  you can get rekt grade-wise.\n",

            review: 'They say YMMV and that may be true for everybody.\nThis class is no joke nor walk in the park. You really need to know python coding and dominate numpy, pandas, and matplotlib modules since they seem to be needed (At least thus far) for coding projects.\nFor experienced ML people this class might be easy, but for someone wanting to get into the topic it can get difficult. BEWARE, it is not an easy/hand holding class that you would expect at the beginning of the program.\nThis class on the overall (at least this far) seems like a Finance/Investments class, with some ML "sprinkled" in since that is what some Stock Broker\'s may have/use at their shops.\nOverall, it is a good class, but be prepared to put in the hours and the work!\nAbout to take the midterm, will update my comment when I am done with the class.',

            review: 'This is a relatively easy course compared to other Machine Learning electives. It provides a good introduction to Machine Learning in general, as well as introduction to stock markets. For CS background students, the finance part is more valuable.\nThere are assignments about every two weeks (some easy assignments have one week due from the last one). Assignments are not hard if you get all the requirements sorted out, but the description itself may be ambiguous. I would recommend starting at least 1 week before due to having enough time asking questions. It’d be the best to complete 1 week before due at the beginning to have more time to work on later assignments. The last 3 assignments (6-8) are more difficult than previous ones (but still relatively easy compared to other courses), especially the last one (Project 8). Also note they are not equally weighted.\nExams are not straightforward to learn. They are taking questions from all course materials, including the movie (I was surprised by the number of questions from the movie). Try to pay attention to every detail, especially those that are not covered in assignments. Personally I feel it’s much easier to remember if you practice in assignments already, and there were definitely questions I wasn’t expecting to be asked.\nTo summarize, it’s a fun course with useful contents. It’s not hard to get an A if you can consume all the contents from the course.',

            review: 'Took this class with Dr. Joyner along with his HCI class during the summer. This class took up most of my time during the weeknights to read through the lecture notes, coding and debugging. Saturdays and Sundays were spent writing the report. It was tough managing the two courses, but it was very rewarding learning Python through practical projects and implementation. Brushed up a lot on Python fundamentals and learned OOP.\nEnvironment setup with the virtual machine took a bit to get started, but TA Steven Bryant was fantastic in posting tutorials and answering all questions about the projects. The class is consisted of 8 projects with varying weighted grade % along with two exams. Some projects are built on top of each other and the class is back-loaded with the final 3 projects the most challenging.  Exams are straight-forward if you study the lecture notes. TAs and Professor Joyner are amazing in participating in discussions on online forum. Ed is used instead of Piazza and it is great!\nSome projects require reports which are very time-demanding. I highly recommend read through the problem statement, requirements, and needed data to support your solutions. With a course of over 200 students, Gradescope is used to autograde your code and a structured template is implemented for the report for consistency. As a result, you may find it confusing and frustrating to write the reports and get points deducted if you missed anything. SO READ EVERYTHING ON THE REPORT SUBMISSION PAGE VERY CAREFULLY.\nHighly recommend this course for a coding class for OMSA CDA track. It took a lot of efforts, but it was very rewarding as I learned a lot about trading strategies and indicators. Ended up with over 95% course grade and got A for HCI. It is doable to pair the both classes together.',

I took this class because it was the summer and a lot of reviews mention that is an easy class(this was the lowest of my grades because the reports and I didn't have time to study for the tests). I lost the interest in the first units because the videos are terrible and kind of boring. This is the kind of class where you need to finish the report at least two days before the deadline because you find you need to update the report. I finished some reports on the weekends and was the worst.\nThe projects and report rubrics are a mess and they add some difficulty. I was really busy this semester and was impossible to have a good score because I have a lot of deductions in the reports. I took DL and ML before and my score was better and I learned more in these classes.\nThe coding projects are easy, but are hard to understand because they don't give you enough code to start. Some times you only need less than 10 lines of code but you spend the time trying to understand what they need.",

            review: "The lecture content of the course is very informational and well laid out. It explores some of the fundamental of trading and expands on some technical aspects of trading by incorporating Machine Learning. If you are familiar with trading in general, this would definitely add to your knowledge.\nI took this course in summer so there were weekly projects and some of them also had reports to fill out. The project portion (coding) wasn't hard at all given you watch all the lectures and the office hours recording from Dr. Balch where he walks through the project and basically tells you how to go about doing your project (for some of them). You do explore ML techniques and build on top of it. Make sure you code each project as if you will use it in future projects because that is exactly what this course does. You build on top of your existing work. Previous ML/Pandas knowledge will be super helpful but not necessary as they go over it in detail in the beginning of the class.\nFor the reports, pay very close attention to the project requirements and answer exactly what they are asking, or else you will lose points.\nThe exams are multiple-choice but you definitely want to prep for them . Study guide for the first exams was much helpful compared to second one.\nOverall, this a great class for you if you are interested in learning about trading along with using ML to analyze trading data to provide buy/sell markers.",

They are an absolute mess and probably the most difficult part of the class is trying to make sure you didn't miss one of the hundreds of requirements scattered throughout 20 pages of jumbled instructions that could have been either handled by an auto grader or condensed into a couple pages.\nThe last couple projects are interesting and worth while, so I would say that the class is a good summer class or class to double up as it is an easy class but still somewhat interesting.",

            review: 'This was my sixth course in the OMSCS program.  I took it during the Summer 2021 term.  The ideas of machine learning and finance were very interesting to me.  The class has 8 projects, 2 exams, and an extra credit opportunity.  The teaching staff is very involved with the course in Ed.  I took this course as many labeled it as an easy course, but for me, the machine learning knowledge was very useful and conveyed in a straight-forward manner.  There are some challenging aspects, but overall, it is a worthwhile course.\nCoursework\n\nProject 1 (3%): This was a nice intro project for the course.  It simulated a roulette betting generator utilizing numpy and matplotlib libraries.  The main deliverable was a report.\nProject 2 (3%): This project focused on optimizing the allocations for some stocks.  It also included calculating some common metrics used in the finance world.\nProject 3 (15%): This project focused on creating and assessing various learners.  These included learners for Decision and Random Trees, Linear Regression, Insane Learners, and Bootstrap Aggregation Learners.  It also required writing code to test these learners.  This project required significant work.\nProject 4 (5%): This project teaches how to design datasets to defeat Linear Regression and Decision Tree Learners.  Understanding both learners makes completing this assignment fairly easy and quick.\nProject 5 (10%): This project focuses on simulating the market.  It involves taking buy and sell orders, applying them to prices, and keeping track of the cash flow over a given date range.\nProject 6 (7%): This project focuses on picking and implementing 5 technical indicators which can be interpreted as actionable buy/sell signals.  Whatever indicators are selected for this project are required to be used on Project 8.  Some code from Project 5 is used as part of this project, but it required some significant work and a report with a maximum of 10 pages.\nProject 7 (10%): This project involved implementing a Q-Learning robot.  The test cases simulated a robot moving from one point to another in the most efficient was possibly.  The Q-Learner would use different techniques to test various paths in order to propose the most efficient route.\nProject 8 (20%): This project took a lot of time and analyzing.  It incorporates all concepts and projects covered through the course.  It involved using manual and strategy learners to pick trades which would yield the largest profit.  The indicators selected in Project 6 must be used in Project 8.  It is required to create a manual strategy based on the interpreting the indicators to manually pick a set of trades.  It also requires creating a Strategy Learner which uses a learner from Project 3.  This learner changes the criteria of the indicators to help determine the best trades to make.  The project also requires creating 2 files to run some experiments as well a testproject file to run all the code necessary to generate data and charts for the report, which is up to 10 pages long.  In the end, I spent over 45 hours on this project, and I felt like my solution was still incomplete.\nMidterm Exam (12.5%): This exam has 30 multiple choice questions.  You have 35 minutes to take the exam.  The exam covers the first half of the class, is closed everything, and is proctored by HonorLock.\nFinal Exam (12.5%): The exam has 30 multiple choice questions.  You have 35 minutes to take the exam.  The exam covers material since the midterm, is closed everything, and is proctored by HonorLock.\n\nTake-Aways\n\nMiscellaneous Stuff: Instead of using Piazza for the discussion forum and Canvas for the lectures, the ed platform was used.  In my opinion, it was horrible.  Searching for items was a nightmare, to the extent of it was easier (and faster) to post a question and it be marked as duplicate than to do a search and have to wade through irrelevant and unmatched results.  The entire work for the class is posted at the start, so it is easy to get ahead on work.  The summer course covers the same amount of material as the spring and fall, but the timeframe is much more condensed.  Some projects in the fall and spring normally get two weeks until it is due; however, you are only allowed one week for every project.  While the class is worthwhile and somewhat easy, taking it during the summer proved to be a lot more difficult than taking it during a different term.\nTextbook: There is 1 required textbook and 2 optional textbooks.  One of the optional textbooks (Machine Learning) is a good, affordable book if you are interested in machine learning (but also a required book for another machine learning course).\nMovie: There is a movie you have to watch as one of weekly assignments.  It is The Big Short.  You may find it streaming for free, but you can also rent it from Amazon or buy a physical disc for cheap.  A good number of questions on the final exam come from the movie.\nProjects: The projects are interesting and relevant to the course.  Most of the projects are Python.  The biggest issue is the reports for the projects, which require you to stick to a very strict document format (to the extent of font, spacing, formatting, alignment, decimal tab alignment, and table and chart formats).  Projects 3, 6, and 8 took quite a bit of time, so you should start on it early.  You are required to setup a local environment (watch the video and set it up exactly like they describe).\nExams:  There is a mid-term and final exam in this class.  Both exams are 30 questions, all multiple-choice.  The only thing making them tough is only having 35 minutes to take the exam.  It is easy to take them and have time left, but it can be stressful if you like to read the questions slowly to understand or want to go back and double check your selections.  Unlike other courses I have taken, they do not provide you with the exam or show you the questions you got incorrect.  You have to submit posts to them to ask what you missed so you can contest it.\nProfessor and TAs: The entire teaching staff was great.  They took an active role in Ed, which made getting help and questions answered easy.  Unlike some other courses, the posts stayed on topic pretty well.  Some TAs may be a little more harsh or crass, but given a class with almost 1000 students, a large TA staff, and students across the globe, this is somewhat to be expected.\nOverall Grade: I feel like I put an acceptable amount of time in this course (over 242 hours to be exact).  In the end, my grade was 91.2, which got me an A.  The grade distribution is the standard A (90.0+), B (80.0 to 89.9), C (70.0 to 79.9), D (60.0 to 69.9), and F (less than 60).\n\nTLDR\nThis class is somewhat easy and straight-forward.  Having no experience in machine learning, I was still able to do well in this course.  The coursework is all available once the class starts, so it is easy to know what is coming and to stay ahead.  Some of the projects take some time, so start early.  Taking the course during the summer kind of sucks because it covers the same amount of material as the spring and fall semesters, but the material is compressed (spring and fall semesters have 2 weeks for several projects compared to only 1 in the summer).  The Ed platform is horrible.  Having more than 35 minutes would be nice when taking the 30 question exams.  Not a whole lot of reading.  The lectures are very informative and well delivered.  All-in-all, it is a great class for the summer or for people just starting the OMSCS program, but I feel it would definitely be easier and less stressful taking it during the fall or spring terms.',

The reasoning for this is that this is my sixth course in the program, and there was very little new in the course to learn despite how much work it could be. In short, if you've taken a few ML courses already, you'll be bored and mildly frustrated.\nThe only real difficulty in this course came from having to complete a project a week. Which wasn't terrible, but still a lot of writing/coding to do in a short time span. Just start them all early and on time and you'll be fine. The greatest difficulty in the reports are making sure you read every single line in the assignment as things like what color your lines are matter on your graphs.\nI used a Windows computer with Anaconda/PyCharm and that was fine, I couldn't run the testing file given, but submitting to Gradescope worked decently. Would be nice if that didn't matter.\nI did take away Technical Indicators which are interesting and having to watch The Big Short makes one a bit angry at the world.\nAnyway, this is a good first ML course, but beyond that not much more.",

            review: "Background\n\nThis is my second course in OMSCS, having taken HCI.\nI work with Python/Pandas/Numpy on a daily basis at my job as a data analyst, so the focus of my learning was on the course content itself, particularly around ML, and less on the technical aspect of the language/libraries. I'd recommend knowing Python prior to entering the course. You could probably learn pandas on the fly, but even just a bit of prior exposure to DataFrames and vectorization would be beneficial.\nDidn't major in CS in undergrad, but I did take several CS classes. I majored in Economics and while I was very familiar with financial markets prior to entering the course, I still learned a lot about some theorems like the Efficient Market Hypothesis, Sharpe Ratio, Optimal Portfolio Allocation, and Technical Analysis that I hadn't come across before. I don't think you need any financial knowledge to succeed in the class.\n\nThings I liked\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed the course and felt it was a concise but well-rounded introduction to ML. I greatly enjoyed learning about random forests, decision trees, and reinforcement learning. Professor Balch is phenomenal in his lectures -- funny but thorough. If any reviews say the course is \"easy\", I'm confident it's because he does such a good job with communicating the course content.\nThe TAs were great in my experience. I particularly appreciated Steven Bryant, who was just on top of every question on Ed. Phenomenal person who shared many of Professor Balch's best qualities in explaining complex things in a simple and easy-to-grasp manner. Steven was an important part of my success in this course because of how thorough his Ed responses were.\nThe course is a good one for the summer in my opinion, but the weeks are very uneven. Each week is one of 8 projects. Projects 3, 6, and 8 in my opinion were the toughest. These weeks were anywhere between 20-30 hours. The other ones were relatively easier, probably averaging closer to 10-12 hours. Hence I spent about 17 hours on average, but just note that this distribution is skewed.\nThe midterm exam was fair and straightforward. I won't talk about the final as we are in the \"quiet\" period.\n\nFeedback and Tips\n\nI almost dropped this course because setting up the environment seemed so complex. Part of this may be that it's my first time doing it, since my prior course was HCI. My recommendation is to do VirtualBox running Ubuntu. I would recommend JupyterLab as your IDE, which should greatly speed up your testing and development time if you figure out how to use it.  SSH into your environment with VisualStudioCode. You can then run JupyterLab from within your environment, but develop on it within a browser on your local machine. Getting this setup right and comfortable for quick development was a foundational reason I could succeed in the class.\nA lot of reviews talk about how the project descriptions need to be reworked. My experience was certainly not as bad as some of the reviews here make it out to be, but I still tend to agree. I think this could mostly be fixed with some simple formatting improvements and structure -- don't put things in the Rubric that aren't also mentioned in the main project body for example. Make the project description flow more chronologically, so that I'm not jumping around the page trying to ensure I have all the pieces necessary.\nThe projects build upon each other, so don't skimp on Project 3 because you'll be using the same pieces to successfully complete Project 8.\nGoing from the first day to submitting Project 1 is the toughest stretch in my opinion, since you're getting your environment setup and spending extra time getting accustomed to how to submit files and such. Project 3 is the toughest in my opinion. Project 6 takes more planning and research, but is not as challenging to implement. Project 8 was long due to having to write a 10-page report (where I feel like the content might've necessitated 12-15 pages), but the actual coding for it wasn't too bad. The other projects felt like rest weeks interspersed between the hard ones.\nI'd rewatch the requisite lectures for the exams. Having that quick refresher can help you from second-guessing yourself.\nDon't underestimate this course's difficulty. I personally think it's a \"Medium\" compared to HCI which I had as an \"Easy\". It can be discouraging if your expectations aren't aligned with the course's demands.\nI didn't do any of the required reading, although I skimmed it. It mostly just reviews what the lectures cover. Prof. Balch's book is well written though if you'd like to have it for reference, but I think you can succeed without doing the reading.\n",

If you have a background in pandas/numpy, this course will likely be a breeze which is likely what is bringing down the workload number for a lot of people, though it will serve as a fun introduction to trading and finance. The lectures were great, though there was a whole section of lectures (there are 3 sections) that was strictly related to an introduction to finance and trading, which is important for tests but generally useless for the projects.\nIf you don't have a background in pandas/numpy, note this course has non-trival difficulty since its like learning how to program all over again to not be able to use for loops and try and vectorize as much of your code as humanly possible to work within the runtime limitations. The coding in this course was (MUCH) harder than AI4R which felt like a joke in terms of coding difficulty, most of the difficulty in that class was understanding the concepts well enough to code them. Compared to another \"easy\" class, KBAI, the programming difficulty is far greater. ML4T is not necessarily a difficult course in terms of programming difficulty, but you should know your way around code.\nMake sure to set up your environment early, which is probably one of the biggest downsides of this course. The provided testers will only work in linux (unless you want to submit it to Gradescope testing, instead of testing performance locally), and it uses an older version of Python.\nThe projects are generally well explained as they have accompanying lectures, and the TA's were very helpful on edstem (1 in particular so you may not be so lucky). Some projects take much longer than others (if you don't care about optimizing your performance so that it passes every single seed, 1 project literally takes 1 hour max if you have a decent handle of np/pd by the time you get to it and understand the concepts). In fact, if you are looking for an easy A you can probably make Project 6 and the final Project much easier on yourself by choosing easy methods to implement them so you can spend more time on your report, but I would question why you would be taking this class in the first place if this was case.\nAn addendum to the projects, however, is that the grading structure is sort of poorly explained, and you need to look at Edstem for clarification, which isn't the biggest deal. One thing that will give you a heart attack is that you can test your code in Gradescope, but when submitting, you won't know how your code performed in the ACTUAL grading tests (which may be done with different seeds) until about a week later, which brings me to one of the negatives of this course, the grading. You won't receive your grade for a PROGRAMMING assignment until about a week later, and for a written report you won't see it until 2 weeks later at the least, which is tough because having feedback on Project 6 would have helped for the final project.\nThe exam was somewhat fair, you had access to previous exams and the actual exam has a similar structure/topics. I hated how there is required reading which covers the SAME topics as in the lectures so you gloss over it, but find that there is 1 small detail you missed from the readings that is covered in the exam.\nIf you have an interest in financial machine learning, this is a good INTRODUCTORY course, and nearing the end, I actually wish it was far more intensive and allowed you to use modern libraries (such as sklearn) to solve problems and create experiments.\nNote: the time/difficulty may be inflated because I took this over the summer",

            review: "After several weeks in this course, I feel really compelled to write a review. I don't like this course. Obviously made an error, somewhat, taking this in the summer, but still I don't think or agree that students should be subjected to this much trouble taking any course.\nFirstly, I should clarify that this is not coming from a point of zero effort. Presently, I have had perfect scores on all projects so far, except for the midterm where I got a 28/30. So, I do expect to get an A. However, that doesn't hold me back from saying that the course design is very, very poor. The content appears good and I do like it, but the design is horrible.\nThe projects are a mess. Nearly every project is a jumble of instructions, caveats, methods, etc., with most of these saying nothing and all things at the same time. I have a feeling this is clearly a case of \"too many cooks spoil the broth\", as someone below me pointed out. Certainly there are many instructors or professors tinkering with the project instructions every single term. Strangely, many of these details are absolutely unnecessary for the completion of the assignments. I feel a better design (if they wanted that much detail) would have been to let Gradescope decide what's good and what's not, and end it there. So, that all the nuances about colors, size, labels, legends, etc. would be left to the computer to decide (if they really cared). Apparently though, your codes passing on Gradescope looks to be insufficient. At least, that's what other students have pointed out. You could still lose marks in reports, I guess, or if your plot were green instead of red.\nThe platform, edstem, is also not very good, in my opinion. It's not easy to navigate through this platform or to easily find resources. I had a hard time simply locating where the schedule for the office hours was. It is also not very easy making out the responses to specific questions in the chain of replies. Besides, for a student population coming from using Piazza in other courses, diving into this new platform can be immediately jarring, at least in the first few weeks. I don't understand why they can't just stick with Piazza.\nThe TA's are okay, but I don't see them offering that many quality feedbacks on some of the projects. For the Extra Credit project, for example, it was a candid \"Sorry, we don't have any more information than you do\". I'm not even sure if anyone in the class was able to do the Extra Credit project. I certainly didn't attempt it. It simply wasn't worth it diving into more information than I was willing to process. This makes me wonder why it is included. The objective doesn't appear to be wanting to help students augment their marks, I'd guess.\nI'd say the difficulty of this course is about medium. If you are coming from a ML background, having worked as a quant or something, you may find this to be easy difficulty. If you have little to no programming experience, it will definitely be hard difficulty. If you are average in programming and can google Stackoverflow, this will be about medium for you, as long as you start the projects early and can quickly churn out the reports. For someone like me taking two additional courses this Summer (yea, I wish i wasn't, lol!), I'm able to effectively manage this course because I write a lot and have decent programming experience. Having taken DVA also helped since the information overload is about the same (or much less, really). In fact, at least one project in both courses is a little similar (e.g. Decision Learner).\nOverall, I'm just not having the information overload this course presents. I guess that's my major grouse. Pages and pages of irrelevant detail that don't matter for the actual coding or learning. Good luck taking this course, if you want to. Better luck taking it in Summer.",

            review: "Summary\n\nPretty solid introduction to machine learning, NumPy/Pandas and stonks.\nCourse definitely has room for improvement and workload can be a little intense at times but I would definitely recommend taking it.\nI took this course with having a decent background in Python, statistics and the stock market. I feel like people with an ML background breeze through this course and then bring down the average workload with their reviews\n\nGood\n\nThe majority of the lectures are well done and informative\nYou learn a lot from the course\nMaterial is fun and engaging and the projects you do are really cool\nTAs are very helpful\nInstructors seem very eager for feedback and like they want to improve the course\nCourse is fairly well organized (with one caveat concerning project requirements)\nDifffculty and workload are overall reasonable\n\nBad\n\nSome of the lectures are pretty bad (basically all the ones on YouTube are 20 minutes of useful material stretched out to hour long, low quality live streams of somewhat outdated lectures)\nProjects need more polishing:\n\nRequirements are confusing as hell (e.g.: Project 3 has a 5500 word document describing it and you need to comb through a bunch of Ed posts for further clarification)\nIt's very easy to make a little slip-up in your project and deductions for it are huge (e.g.: losing 50% of your report grade if you graph data from 2008-2011 instead of 2008-2009)\nRequirements don't make it clear how thorough you need to be with your answers to questions asked for the report. Questions asked can be answered 1 paragraph or 1 page depending on how much detail you give and you have no way of knowing what TAs want\nProjects build on each other and no solutions are given so if you mess up 1 project, it can cascade and cause you to mess up on the next project\nProjects feel very all-or-nothing. Either you've completed it and tests pass in which case you get >90% or you're missing something (can be 1 tiny detail) and tests fail and you get <30%\n\n\nFeedback is super slow, we were about half-way through the course before getting any grades for the course\nSetting up your dev environment is a headache\nExam 1 (and probably Exam 2) aren't very good\n\n2 practice exams are provided, 1 is extremely useful and 1 is basically trash (hint: the trash one is >500 questions long where some questions are incomplete / not in English)\nExam prep pages have lots of out-dated info on them\nThe exam itself is way too easy and doesn't allow you to use a pen and paper. Basically it's just quizzing you on rote memorization\nI've only written Exam 1 but I expect Exam 2 to follow the same format, I'll amend my review if this isn't the case\n\n\n\nTips\n\nThe course starts off slow and project details are finalized 3 weeks before they are due. Spend a lot of time the first couple weeks getting ahead of the course material since you'll likely need that extra time when you reach the larger projects\n",

            review: "This course should be renamed as Finance 101 + Python 101. The course content is quite straight forward and some what interesting. Understanding all the materials is really easy. However, as mentioned by previous posts, what makes ML4T ugly is its assignment design and grading policies. I have never seen such long and useless project requirements in my past 20 years' study. The TAs that designed those rubrics should definitely receive more trainings in writing. Besides, all those awkward requirements is really meaningless. As a person that works as a quant and is familiar with the whole course content, I see no point in designing the assignments in this way. After figuring out that I could not learn anything from either the course content or those assignments, I quit this course to save the rest of my summer.",

            review: 'Regarding the reviewer below who posted:\n"People who drop and hate this course tend to complain and post negative reviews before the course is over."\nIf, based on how poorly requirements and communication were done and on the "micro managing", people hated the course enough to drop it before the semester is over, then this bias is justified. Does the reviewer who made this comment think that those who hated the course enough to drop it will change their minds with more weeks of poor requirements and communication and micro managing? These things cannot be attributed solely to the course being held in the summer. The micro managing and confusing requirements happen because the course and its content have not been thought out well, and nobody seems to care enough to do anything about it, especially because as I understand, this material is recycled from one semester to another, and is the reason why an official solution to the assignments is never released. In any case, the Fall 2020 set of reviews contains 6 reviews that are either disliked or strongly disliked and 9 reviews that are either liked or strongly liked, which seems to vindicate the negative reviews for the summer 2021 semester.\nI recommend taking a different course, even if you plan on taking it in a full-length semester.',

            review: "I highly recommend taking a different course\nWhat I liked\nThe course seemed to be of reasonable difficulty for the summer semester. The lectures were concise and informative, and the material was mostly review (through project 3).\nWhat I didn't like\nOffice hours and additional lecture material were hard to find. Several students had to request help in locating the OH material because it was buried in the forum.\nThere is a custom reporting format that is the definition of micro managing, except it is missing some of the most critical aspects for academic reporting, such as citations.\nBooks were pushed hard, but forum posts by the staff indicated that they are not used in the exams, nor are they part of the curriculum. $200+ dollars for texts that will go unused is a waste.\nThe class requires a local linux (Ubuntu) environment, but none of the instructors could put together a how-to for students who were struggling.\nIf you take this class, just use the WSL2 feature, install Ubuntu, and then add anaconda. It's super easy and much more convenient than creating a VM.\nAs of project 3, the local environment was neither used nor required.\nThe grading rubric stated that you will lose 10 points on every homework regardless of whether your answer was correct.\nClarification was slow and took multiple rounds of interaction before clear instructions were provided. Often the responses were received after the project deadline.\nFrustrations\nI'm not sure if this is a gripe or a change, so I'll note this as a frustration. Instead of using Piazza and other resources that the rest of the courses utilized, this course used a different forum and grading system that caused a lot of consternation among the students. If Piazza is going away, then this is a change, and no worries, but the school should stick with one platform.\nAppeal for Change\nThis class really showcases the need for improvements in the online courses at GT. I love this school, and it pains me to see this kind of poor performance.\nThere is no doubt in the instructors', TA's, and students' abilities, however, the execution and communication issues that plague this program are severe and difficult to work around.\nPlease address these ridiculous communications issues and clean up the admin side of the program.\nFull Disclosure\nI dropped this course at project 3 due to moving and starting a new job. I expected a good grade in this class and even with the frustrations, it is paced appropriately for the summer.\nWhile I don't recommend it as a class, if you do need an \"easier\" summer class, this fits the bill. Just expect to spend some extra time working through issues.",

            review: 'The Good\n\nProfessor Balch\'s lectures are informative and entertaining\nEven having taken multiple courses in machine learning, I came away with new awareness\nOne does not need to actually enroll in this course to have access to the lecture material since Professor Balch makes it available for free on udacity\n\nThe Bad\n\nAs is usual for many MOOCs, this course suffers from problems in communication\nFar more time is spent on bureaucratic nonsense than should be required, in proportion to value-added time such as coding and understanding the algorithms\nAs good as Professor Balch\'s video lectures are, they aren\'t actually helpful to completing the assignments, aside from a very high-level view of how certain algorithms work\nSorry, but who is Joyner? The only "interaction" the class has with him is the weekly notification of new course material. This could be (or possibly is) done by a bot.\n\nThe Ugly\n\nIronically, despite demands for meticulous accuracy and precision in how assignments are to be submitted, the teaching staff does not hold itself to these same standards\nThe course appears to be designed by committee and has all the markings of "too many cooks ..." (seriously, who designed this course and its delivery? Balch, Joyner, Bryant, anyone else?)\nTypically, the assignment has a rubric to be followed, which when printed off on 8.5 x 11 consumes 1/2 dozen pages\nThe rubric is only a starting point - in addition, you need to refer to a description of an API, lecture videos, other assorted youtube videos, downloads of documentation on which methods you are expected to use (heaven forbid you use some other method even if that method doesn\'t call a fobidden scipy library function)\nInevitably, with so much content on the rubric (and the corresponding detailed requirements on submission), questions are sure to arise\nThe clarifications to such questions are often as confusing as the original source of doubt in the rubric\nWorse, the rubric is not updated - instead you have to follow the discussion board for updates and clarifications\nIn at least one case that I am familiar with, after 3 "clarifications", the requirements still weren\'t clear, and quite honestly, could have been solved by simply stating how the autograder will call your function(s). For example:\n\nRequirements stated:\n\nDoes the code generate the appropriate chart written to a .png file? (-10 points)\nDoes the code create charts that are displayed on the screen or in a window when the code is run? (-10 points)\n\n\nHilariously, it seems to imply that if you "generate the appropriate charts" you will be punished by losing 10 points, just as if your code was popping up charts in the runtime (legitimately "bad behavior" that should result in losing points)\nAfter several attempts at explaining, including misleading comments about how the default value for creating charts is used, what would have answered the doubts immediately (or had this been stated in the requirements, obviated any need for clarifications), would have been to state:\n\nThe autograder will always call your function with a False value for the optional parameter gen_plot, which can accept either True or False\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommendations\nFor course creators\n\nHave a single person, and not a committee, design the course content\nThoroughly read over the content from the point of view of the student, who may or may not be familiar with trading terminology, strategy, etc. and phrase the rubric in English\nIf you can\'t state your requirements clearly, you surrender all claim to demand precisely-named output files, or precisely-formatted reports, or other precise instructions\n\nFor future students\n\nAvoid taking this course until the shortcomings mentioned above are addressed (unless you love to wallow in frustration, poorly-communicated requirements, and endless bureaucracy)\n',

You won't build a project that will make you rich, but you will gain good knowledge of how the market works and the concept of a way to make buy/sell decisions based on a learning.\nThe projects weren't too difficult, but a few did require a little digging. The projects do build on each other, so you need to keep up. The exams are in my opinion very fair. They provided a study guide of example questions. If you spend a couple nights going through the questions you should be ok on the tests, so long as you understood the material.\nIf you're familiar with Joyner courses, you already know there is some writing required, and you must pay close attention to the rubric for credit on these papers, but grading seemed to be fair if you answered every question.",

It was really cool to apply reinforcement learning to stocks and to build up pieces of various learners throughout the course with it culminating in the final assignment.

Definitely know how to code or else you'll have a rough time (I still find it weird having to say this for a computer science masters, but whatever).",

(results were valid)\nTip: I took the time to create my own LaTeX template based off the requirements for this course.\nIt took me about 1 hour to complete and is worth the time if you are not familiar with LaTex.\nI highly recommend using a system like Overleaf to store and write your assignments.\nExams\nThe exams were pretty easy, as long as you keep notes during the lectures you should have everything you need to get a good score.\nApplication to ML\nThis course gives a very high level overview of ML strategies and investigates a few interesting topics.\nIt left me wanting to know more, which was a plus.\nIf you are on the fence about ML, I feel this is a great course to gauge your interest.\nConclusion\nAll things being said I felt this was a nice, easy course to get me back in the school mindset.\nThe projects are interesting, and if you are even remotely interesting in stocks and trading, I feel you will enjoy this class.",

Have a full time executive job. This is my fourth masters.\nFor my point of view, this class was excellent. Very well articulated, with great content and projects. It was a great introduction to ML and I feel it was a great experience overall.\nHowever, I my opinion, and perhaps due to my background, I do not consider this class easy or very easy by any means. It is HARD, and VERY demanding in time, requires very high attention to detail, and it can be very tricky in terms of implementing your projects and reports.\nIf you watch the videos, take notes, review the homework assignments you will spend way more than 5h/week as some of the other reviews. I agree that the time required for each project varies greatly but disagree with others that in their assessment of difficulty.\n(1) Please be sure you are very comfortable with Python, Pandas, Numpy.\n(2) Start your projects as early as possible as even when it works, you will discover multiple technical issues you did not expect (i.e. when submitting that there are max execution time requirements that can render your grade to zero if not met).\n(3) Enjoy the class, spend quality time understanding the concepts as I find they are very useful for this class and future ones.\nIf you are a python, or ML expert you might need only <6 hrs/ week. For the rest of us without that background, be prepared to spend easily 15-20 hrs/week.\nOverall, great class. Highly recommended. Just be aware that for many, it not as easy as other reviews make it look like. So please, do not underestimate it.',

Also, don't be scared by the amount of questions in the question pool, the exams are easy.",

A good programmer can breeze through this course, but all non CS students beware that this course is really really hard. Master numpy, pandas if you want to take this course as well as get good hold on programming. Exams are easy, if you prepare from the old questions . Excellent TAs and projects were interesting and you will learn a lot. I did not need the text book . Though this course was really hard, i ended up with an A , I will highly recommend this course for the content and learning.',

            review: "I was looking for a class to double up with, and this one was perfect for it. All the projects are available on the website so I could work as far ahead as I needed to keep pace in both classes. The content was an easy overview of the stock market and basic machine learning algorithms. Prof Balch's enthusiasm for the topic shows in the lectures and I really enjoyed watching them. Very little outside research was needed. The lectures and project descriptions gave me all the tools I needed to solve all the problems. The extra research I did was for python, numpy, and pandas. I entered this class with no experience with any of them.\nAll the projects are very accessible. Not something that I would like to cram on the night before, though. Often I would run into a problem and come back the next day with a solution, or note something in the project description that I missed before. The hardest projects with the biggest reports took about three weeks, and the shortest projects with no reports took under a day. I put in one to two hours a day in this class - either watching lectures or working on a project. I recorded the date I finished each project, report and all. So you have some idea of my pace:\nProject 1 : Martingale\t\t\t\tCompleted 1/19 (report)\nProject 2 : Optimize Something\tCompleted 1/23\nProject 3 : Assess Learners\t\tCompleted 2/9  (report)\nProject 4 : Defeat Learners\t\tCompleted 2/9\nProject 5 : Marketsim\t\t\t\tCompleted 2/17\nProject 6 : Indicator Evaluation\tCompleted 3/7  (report)\nProject 7 : QLearner\t\t\t\tCompleted 3/18\nProject 8 : Strategy Evaluation\t\tCompleted 4/5  (report)\nThe most frustrating part is the way the project descriptions are written. The entire document is important and little necessary pieces are embedded in each section. Something that's vital to the report may be one sentence in a method description. You really have to read them carefully in order to meet all the requirements.\nThe exams have a time limit of 30 minutes. While I stressed a bit about the time, the actual exams took maybe only half that, but I'm a fast MCQ test taker. You may want to factor this into your decision to take the class.\nThat aside, it's just a really well done class that's definitely worth your time. I thoroughly enjoyed it.\nDown side: The Big Short (2015) is part of the content and on the final exam.",

            review: 'Ooof, this one was rough. I went in looking for an moderate class based on the reviews. I struggled, even though I work in ML at $DAYJOB and have an amateur understanding of finance. Part of my problem was stacking this with another class (AI Ethics), which often had similar due dates. One great thing about this class is that you can work ahead, which can help in some cases.\nThe pace seemed pretty uneven, some projects took 10+ hours, then the project for the next week would only take ~ 2 hours. It was really hard to get a feel for the time commitment. The test code environment seemed very brittle, however it got better as the class progressed. Just make sure to do good on P3, P6 and P8 and you should be good. The directions for each project are VERY dense and contain alot of little details that are easy to miss and can hurt your grade. I lost a lot of points by missing directions that were buried in a non-obvious part of the project notes. Also some of the projects require reports, which for me took longer than writing the code, so beware. The exams are fairly average, some of the wording is tricky. Just use the anki flashcards to study, most of the lectures are a chore to get through.',

            review: 'Know that you’re not gonna start your own quant hedge fund after completing CS7646. Have realistic expectations; CS7646 is more of an introduction.\nThings I really appreciate:\n\nSpecifications & files for all projects are given upfront, giving students full flexibility in their schedules. This is not the case for other modules I’ve taken, where content is released on a strict weekly basis.\nEx-Prof. has real life experience & incorporates it into lecture material, e.g. “10 ways backtests lie”.\nCourse does a very good job of bridging theory & practice – many projects actually require students to implement trading strategies on stock data. It’s not just a theoretical exercise.\nCourse does a very good job of bringing the entire syllabus together in final project. You’re not just learning stuff in silos.\nTA Steven Bryant must have replied a million questions on the forum. Massive respect for his patience & dedication.\n\nThat said, there are some areas for improvement:\n\nProject descriptions require so much reading I should also receive a liberal arts degree. Project 8’s description in CS7646’s beloved JDF Word format is TWENTY. PAGES. LONG. Important criteria & information are usually stated explicitly, but scattered throughout different sections, necessitating multiple forum threads just to figure out what exactly is being asked.\nPacing of workload across the semester is very uneven. And because later projects draw on earlier projects’ output, you can’t just fail & forget. As far as I know, there is no model answer/example code given for any project. I’d really prefer if we could just use libraries for Project 8, rather than retrofitting our old, libraryless code to a new API. This would put the focus on the trading part.\nContent couldn’t fill the semester up. This is a pity because firstly, CS7646 material is very interesting but very surface. Secondly, a few ML models are already covered in core modules, so it’d be nice to have the course go into greater depth.\nPython 3.6 is kinda old-fashioned by now.\n\nNEUTRAL observations:\n\nCS7646 has a greater-than-usual susceptibility to randomness compared to other modules. E.g. if you rely on random forests repeatedly, you might spend most of your time debugging edge cases long after the model was coded. Also, if you chose indicators in Project 6 that just happen to fit poorly to Project 8 (there’s no way you’d know unless you do this for a living), you’ll be spending hours & days tuning hyperparameters.\n\nIf you don’t have a CS background (like me), some things may appear alien even if you’re familiar with data analytics:\n\nInstalling a virtual machine, specific Linux distributions & Python environments was truly painful. TA’s demo was on a low-res video plus the demo-ed software was different from what was recommended. (Nonetheless, after I finally succeeded, it sure felt good.)\nTon of command line usage. I still prefer double-clicking on applications or “Shift-Entering” in Jupyter. Sometimes I can have all the ML code out in 5min, but figuring out how to implement it according to the specified API, or even how to pull in the data in the first place, takes several times longer. In fact, to this day I still don’t understand the bonus project’s instructions.\nSome programming concepts leaning slightly more towards CS than Analytics will be name-dropped very casually & you are expected to make them work, e.g. recursion & classes.\n\nBut I see merit in the point of view that data science is programming-first, hence I don’t treat these as criticisms; it’s just how it is & everyone’s just gotta deal with it.',

For instance, nobody in the real world will actually code up their own ML learner rather than using scikit-learn or anything else.\nThis class would have been much more useful to me if they had updated the videos from six years ago and reworked the class to get an actual model running somewhere.\nFrankly, I found myself bored and frustrated since I don't think I gained that much from the class besides learning some more holes in my knowledge for algorithmic trading (so it wasn't all bad in that respect.)\nThe lectures and code examples use pretty outdated Python and Pandas  code, so you should be comfortable enough in Python to interpret the intention behind the code and rewrite it as necessary.\nThe TAs seem to enjoy going on power trips and docking insane numbers of points on seemingly minor things, but there is a pretty efficient process to dispute awarded grades that I've had to use a few times (thankfully successfully.)",

            review: 'I personally found the course material to be very interesting but ultimately came away very disappointed with the class. Many of the issues have been discussed in previous reviews but i’ll mention them again here.\n\n\nI found the TAs to be very condescending (mostly one TA tbh) and generally unhelpful. Honestly, most of this came from the way they had us posting on Piazza which was disastrous. They wanted master threads for each project which, with a huge class (1000+ students), just turned into threads that were hundreds of posts long and extremely tedious to read through to hopefully find an answer to your question. Many suggestions were made how to improve organization on Piazza and the responses from TAs generally amounted to “this is the system we made, it works for us, and us saying this is how it’s gonna be should be a good enough answer for you.” Personally, I think a handful of TAs should be willing to adapt to better serve the needs of around 1000 students but I digress.\n\n\nProject PDFs were generally worded poorly with requirements scattered all over the document and sometimes contradictions abound. Took far too much time deciphering what was needed.\n\n\nThe report format was very stringent and could honestly take more time and effort than actually figuring out the code. I get that creating reports and communicating results is important but it seemed to go too far.\n\n\nGrading standards were pretty tough. Minor mistakes could often lead to major point deductions.\n\n\nHW solutions are never released. I get that they re-use assignments every semester and want to prevent cheating but for students that honestly want to learn from their mistakes, this was particularly frustrating.\n\n\nIf you have strong Python skills and can get past the above issues, you’ll probably enjoy this class. You do hit the ground running though and the class can feel like a grind as there’s an assignment due pretty much every week, especially in the first few weeks. My advice would be to start everything early and try to be particularly aware of which assignments are going to take more time. Overall, could be a good class but came away pretty disappointed.',

I think if you don’t have a lot of experience with the python data analysis stack and/or finance/stock trading, then the class will be pretty useful and interesting.  For the first 75% of the course, I held a more negative view on it overall than some of the stellar reviews on OMSCentral.  I went into the course with a lot of python (Pandas/Numpy) exposure and decent knowledge with respect to finance/stock trading, so the negatives of the course got a lot of my attention initially (those being outdated material, convoluted environment setup instructions, messy Piazza, snarky TAs, overly convoluted project instructions, nitpicky report requirements, and odd grading rubrics).  That being said, the last project of the course did somewhat redeem the course.  The project pulls together most of what we had been working on in the first few months of the course and it was pretty satisfying to work on it.    So overall I think I’d recommend it, but I would say temper your expectations a bit maybe.',

When COVID hit, I opted for this course since it did appeal to me for the ML component.\nThis was my 7th course in the OMSCS programme, and I thoroughly enjoyed the lecture content - the teaching staff were all very polite and supportive (albeit quite particular about how we should post in Piazza). I didn\'t like being told to use a master thread for each project, but it is what they wanted, so I just let it be and avoided Piazza (it was too unwieldy to navigate 300+ posts in a single thread for me).\nI asked the TA\'s if it was okay to set up a separate Slack workspace, and they said it was fine, so I set up a personal one and invited the class - about 80 signed up, and we had about 30 active participants - with at least two teaching staff signing in regularly to check in on us, which I thought was really cool.\nD Joyner was "there" but not too "present" in the course, but it was fine, since Josh and Steven and the rest did a fine job of running stuff.\nThe assignments were fun, but the PDF briefs were incredibly convoluted and complicated. I ended up using a highlighter to mark off each line of the document to make sure I didn\'t miss anything finnicky.\nThe course PDF really needs a little refinement (especially on things like why we should use an Ubuntu VM ... so we know what to watch out for if we don\'t, since it was presented as an option to use an Ubuntu VM, but highly recommended. Maybe let us know why that is, so we can make an informed decision?).\nIn summary:\n\ngreat lectures, fun lecturer\ngood assignments, bad assignment PDFs\ngood teaching staff\nweird exam questions focusing on a movie (e.g. one answer is "so and so character opened up to his wife about his dead brother")\ngood content if you want to learn about ML and financial markets\n\nOverall, I am glad that I did this course - and it is the perfect workload for COVID times. You learn good content, and don\'t have to worry about dying of stress in the process.\nDEFINITELY in my top 10 courses in my OMSCS degree!',

Not enough Machine Learning for anyone but a novice, and too much Trading for anyone only marginally interested in the subject. In other words, I would really only recommend this class if you want a very gentle introduction to ML/python/numpy/pandas, or if you're super into finance/stock markets. Of the five classes I've taken so far, this is the first one that I wish, in retrospect, I hadn't, which is kind of a depressing realization to come to; just left with a \"meh\" feeling overall (I very comfortably got an A, fwiw.)\nThings to watch out for:\n\nAbsentee Professor; hardass head TA who will just mark your question as resolved if he doesn't feel like answering it; poorly-specified, purposefully-obfuscated project descriptions riddled with errata carried over from semesters past (but these are fairly common features across OMSCS.) I'm convinced this last feature is the reason the difficulty ratings for this class are all over the place; the things we're being asked to understand/replicate are pretty straightforward, the question is your ability to see the simplicity through the blizzard of nonsense.\n\nA lot of condescending, control-freakish things, eg:\n\nProject template docs contain patterns in the whitespace which we're not allowed to remove and the reason for which \"won't be explained, so don't bother asking us about it\".\nThe document explaining the format your reports need to come in is several pages longer than some of the reports you'll write.\nSome of the projects have rubrics that are dozens of (very detailed) items long, and instead of starting you off at 0 and telling you how many points you'll get for each item, you're started off at 100 and told how many points you'll lose for each missing item, which amounts to the same score, of course, but the latter is much more demoralizing, imo.\nThe midterm and (non-cumulative) final are both 30 multiple choice questions in 35 minutes, so they're more about how quickly you can rule out wrong answers than any deep demonstration of content mastery. Worse yet, you have to submit a special form if you want to know the questions you got wrong on the midterm, but won't receive a response to your submitted form till the eve of the final, and there is no similar option to learn which questions you got wrong on the final! I can't for the life of me imagine what the rationale behind this last one is, but my question regarding such on Piazza was, naturally, marked as resolved without answer.\n\nOn the plus side, some of the coding exercises in some of the projects were kinda fun, I guess. And we were provided with pretty robust testing harnesses.\nFinally, just to counterbalance some of the slander below: in my experience, Steven B. Bryant is by far the kindest, most helpful TA I have yet encountered in this program.",

            review: "This has been my favorite course so far, and I'm 8 courses in. Maybe I'm very biased as I have been deep into the stock market for over a year now and I already had experience making my own indicators and doing some trades with python. I know it's not a deep dive into machine learning, but I used this course as an excuse to really put in the time to learn more about data science, machine learning and stock trading; this is one of the few courses I really wouldn't mind taking again although I'll end up with a good grade. But don't think it will prepare you for the machine learning course; it's a very light introduction. You have to read the entire book(they only ask you to read 4 chapters), and you have to spend serious time outside this course to get a better idea of what machine learning is really about.\nML4T really is a well run course; but the magic sauce was the TA office hours. Everyday, there were two times a day(everyday at different hours to match everyone's schedule), where you could ask questions about that week's assignment. Only general questions were allowed, but the best part of actually talking and hearing others, compared to just reading text on piazza, is that it has been the only experience in OMSCS, other than working in teams, to actually feeling connected to other people. At times I felt stuck and needed help, other times I joined just to help others as I knew areas that would confuse other students as I had problems earlier.\nEvery OMSCS course should have these TA office hours available to students, after taking ML4T I have hope that an online degree can be an enjoyable as well as more productive experience.\nIs it as easy as many reviewers say it is? No, that's just typical CS students trying to show off. It's only that easy if you have years of python experience using vectorized numpy and pandas or have extensive machine learning experience. The stock market info you can pickup while you go; but if you are just starting out with python or do not understand how to vectorize code, you'll drop as you won't get the project working. People saying it's 'super easy, barely and inconvenience' should state what their previous experience was in the first place. This course takes a lot of work, to say it's so easy is a disservice but I get it, people like to brag. It's medium difficulty :)",

I was able to finish most assignments in a few hours and the final project took a weekend. The grading is generous and the tests seemed straightforward (although the final had 3 questions out of 30 about The Big Short, so don't just skim the wiki like I did...).\nPeople like to rip on the TA staff here, but I thought they were fine. For the most part, the website/assignments do a fine job of detailing the requirements. I don't think I've ever seen forums full of such awful questions as I did during this course. Literally hundreds of questions directly answerable via the syllabus or assignment page. I can see why the TA staff was getting frustrated with students. Hell, I was getting frustrated with my fellow students.\nThe other great thing about this course is you can front-load all the work. The assignments are all enumerated ahead of time so you can download the entire repo and work many weeks ahead. This is such an awesome feature of a class.\nThe lectures for this class aren't very good. The professor has an extraordinarily slow southern drawl - I think i listened to all the lectures on 2x speed. One thing to note is that there are additional videos from the professor where he literally spells out how to do most of the assignments. These videos are linked in the syllabus but are non-obvious otherwise. He'll literally go through and tell you how to set up your pandas dataframes, what operations to do...A lot of hand holding in this class for sure.\nOverall, easiest OMSCS class so far, easy assignments, easy tests, light workload.",

            review: "This is a very well managed course, TAs are very strong in their knowledge and are helpful. The head TA is a bit snarky, but I can live with that. I took this course in Spring 2020 and Dr. Joyner gave us all an option to request incomplete as we were all dealing with Covid 19 situation.\nThe pace of assignments is a bit brutal, you are expected to submit a pretty tough assignment in a week. With all the madness and uncertainty I would have gotten a zero if there was no option for an incomplete.\nLectures are brilliant, Dr. Balch is really patient and explains each project very well in his OH recorded videos. The first unit actually is all about introduction to Python, numpy and pandas. Financial jargons might be complex for people with no exposure, but the lessons don't rush them through.\nExams were easy-peasy, we were given a big set of question bank to go through and all the questions (midterm and finals) came from that. There weren't much trick questions, most of the concepts were tested superficially. I also loved watching Big Short, I was pretty awed at how financial crisis of 2008 was explained.\nThis is one course where the content creators actually are interested in having the students get the know how of the subject matter. However, I was a bit disappointed when Dr. Balch admitted that the ML techniques we learnt weren't enough to make money on the stock market. It seems that we need to have a truck load of money to play with and develop an ML algorithm that will generate good returns.\nI ended up getting an A in the course, I would say that getting an A or a B is doable, if you are thorough enough.",

            review: "I would say this course was a bit hard to take during the Summer since the schedule would have 1 month and 1 week less than the Spring/Fall semesters.\nHowever, I can't say enough of how much I enjoyed taking this class. Context: I am software engineer by profession but I have always been very interested in finance and stocks. My assumption was that retail investors can never make money employing trading techniques. Man, this class proved my wrong every step of the way. Probably this explains why I enjoyed the class thoroughly.\nIf you want to learn about the wonderful techniques which can be applied in the real world, make no mistake and take this class. You will be thanking me at the end!\nI was hesitant to write a review before I actually applied the concepts I learned and employed my hard earned money to test them out. Now, I can confidently say that I am on the path to make my first MILLION using the python app I wrote to trade for me.\nGood luck!",

            review: "I am still in this class but overall I am not as excited to finish the semester as I thought I would be.  The videos are good but the assignments leave a lot to be desired.  Workload isn't evenly distributed, either.  One project is 5% of your grade and can take as few as 30 minutes over 2 weeks while another is 7% of your grade and can take upwards of 15 hours to do research on indicators, develop an optimal trading strategy and write a ~8 page report.  This 7% project is also due one week after another ~15 hour project and the midterm.  I would suggest either increasing the amount of time available for this assignment to better reflect the workload.  I felt like I had to take shortcuts to complete this on time and would have liked to more research on the indicators section.\nSince it came up earlier, I've personally had no issues with the TAs and the only time I've seen them be anything less than professional is when someone is asking either a question that is already answered (understandably, Piazza is terrible) or if they are asking a very dumb question (someone asked if they could open PyCharm to help answer questions on the midterm).\nI started the class excited to dip my toes into ML concepts and as I went from week to week, I simply got less excited to see the class through.  I'll likely finish in low-A/high-B territory and most of that is due to subjective grader feedback on reports where I did not hit specific keywords they were looking for.\nTests are completely fair and while they are closed-book, the questions are not \"gotcha\" questions or outlandishly difficult.  Some memorization of (easy) equations needed.\nOverall, the class is fine and I personally disagree that it's an \"easy\" class (easier than many, yes - but I as of this writing this class is only a few \"difficulty points\" above SDP which is basically programming 101).  I'd say it's on the lower end of medium difficulty.  There are worse classes to take.",

            review: "I am writing this at the ~95% mark for the semester. Only thing remaining is the final test.\nOverall, this is an easier course in the program but can be a grind due to the shear number of projects. Overall I liked it, here was my take:\nPros:\n\nLectures are simple and clear\nIntroduction to fundamental python data libraries (pandas, numpy, scipy) for those that haven't used them before or want to dust off the cobwebs\nPiazza is well managed and Instruction team is responsive\nThe course content: Finance basics, Machine Learning Basics, and Technical Trading, are all interesting.\nThe course provides the content needed to succeed on the projects.\nUnderlying concepts the projects teach are very interesting. Final project was the most interesting, I would have preferred to drop 1 or 2 of the earlier assignments that are essentially Pandas 101, and devoted those extra weeks to a more intense ML-project.\nResponsive instruction team.\n\nCons:\n\nHigh Project Over-head: Large number of projects with large readmes hosting a variety of requirements, and requiring reports in a very rigid format, translated to a lot of time being spent doing the mundane work that comes with getting spun up on a project, like copying the code into the right file names and project directories, making charts in the standardized pretty colors desired, etc... I would say at least 50 - 60% of all time I spent on the projects was these extra tasks outside of actually learning the concepts, like trying to figure out how to make pretty charts and get them into the very rigid report format.\nProfessor Involvement: I would personally enjoy an Office Hours or some other professor or Head TA involvement where we dive into certain topics a little further.\n\nThe class size is massive (started at ~800 people). It is possible a lot of complaints towards this class stem from that. The TAs were pretty responsive, and seem to try their best to provide meaningful responses without giving away solutions. There are times where they are very direct, but i can only assume that is to be efficient and probably because they've seen the same question many times.",

            review: 'I don’t want to call out specific TAs, but the TAs in this class in general are not the most helpful ones. That said, it’s a large class, and I would like to imagine that if there were more TAs to help out, they would have been able to respond in much more constructive ways. To be clear and fair, they’re also not the worst by any means though... probably just your average OMSCS experience.\nI’d rather spend more time reviewing the course itself though - I might have had too high an expectation coming into this. You do learn some stuff, and the projects are quite easy if you have experience with python. The reports are just stupid though... personally whenever there is a report involved in a project, I spend 3 times the time on the report than on the actual coding, and you really don’t learn much if anything from writing those reports. The project descriptions could use some overhaul - I think it’s actually worth putting in that effort on the TA/instructors side to do this. A lot of confusions are caused by the poorly structured project descriptions. Requirements are specified and scattered around in various sections, like its actively trying to confuse you. If they could get these fixed, I imagine there will be a lot fewer questions on Piazza and save a lot of time for the TAs.\nIn the end, it’s a fairly easy course, but for me, I don’t think the amount of time I spend trying not to make stupid mistakes / miss or misread a line from the project description is justified. I’d rather spend more time on a course where every minute I spend I’m actually learning something, even if that course requires a whole lot more effort. In that regard, I do really want to recommend how the AI course is run - everything was so clear and automated I didn’t have to bother the TAs even once.',

            review: "I'm halfway through the semester currently, but I've never been rubbed the wrong way by TA posts in Piazza the way I have been in ML4T.\nSteven B. Bryant, a TA for this class, is a narcissistic ***hole.  His tone of voice in replies on Piazza is belittling to students and his comments are sometimes the opposite of helpful, because not only did he not answer the question presented, but he had a comment that was rude.  He probably doesn't see himself like that, which is why I called him narcissistic, but his sense of importance over other students makes me want to vomit.  He forgets that he's a student just like us and we're all here to learn.\nEDIT:\nIn response to the post above: \"I agree with you, we are here to learn. That being said, this is not a kindergarten so stop being naïve to yourself. In this harsh world, and more so in the world of financial trading, no one cares about your feelings. So treat this as a harsh lesson learnt and Deal with it.\"\nResponse:  I do work for the military, so I understand there's no feelings in the world.  I'm not having my emotions upset, I'm irritated by the undertone of absolute disrespect.  Disrespect has no place in the military.  It takes the TA's more words to write out a response that is laced with a disrespectful undertone, than it would to just paste \"@XXXX\".\nI've seen Piazza more efficiently used in the majority of my other classes.  Piazza in this class is disorganized at best and I have a hard time finding the answer because the answer was given once in some obscure location in the thread,.. and then if the question happened to be asked again -- instead of the TA providing \"@XXXX\" like you'll find in other classes, you get some disrespectful and rude comment saying \"It's already been answered... you are wasting our time\"\n-- Thank you for that response, it was much appreciated.  I would have rather looked up the answer previously given if it was easily searchable (which it isn't because Piazza is an absolute cluster in this class).  TA's have to think from our perspective too -- We want answers quickly and if I could have found it through searching or ctrl+f, I would have -- but instead I posted my question and waited 12 hours for a snarky reply.\nStudents work fulltime jobs too.  I don't have times to read 100 pages of threads.  If a question isn't searchable by multiple different tries on keywords, then I'm going to post the question and I expect a helpful reply from a TA because I'm here to learn and I'm paying for this degree out of my own pocket.  I don't expect to be coddled, but I DO expect an answer that is semi-respectful in tone.\nFurther EDIT:  I just saw that one of the co-instructors was in the U.S. Army himself -- which is shocking because he's the leader of the pack and should have a solid understanding of what it means to be respectful.  Shame on him.  He didn't go to West Point, so I'm not quite sure where he learned that behavior from.",

I also had some previous experience in the financial market so that helps a bit as well.\nDon't like readings that much, but the projects are interesting. One thing I want to point out that I really don't like is that on the final exam quite a few questions asked about tedious details in the movie \"The Big Short\" which is unrelated to the actual course content. I almost got 100% on every single project/assignment but I lost points in the final exam on a question asking what game Jared Vennett plays when first introducing the CDS to Mark Baum??? I think those movie scene related questions are unappropriated since it doesn't reflect how well you study machine learning and trading related content.\nOverall super easy class,  recommend taking ML4T with some other course in the same semester.",

Also certain TAs are unnecessarily rude on Piazza, but I mean who can blame them when the instructions are bad enough to make hordes of students feel the need to go to Piazza looking for answers.\nThe written portions of the assignments are time-consuming (generating charts especially) and hard to get perfectly right. I think shifting more of the effort to scoring the assignments quantitatively via a better autograder (and being transparent about it) would help the TAs not have to grade huge walls of charts every week.\nStart the assignments early, especially project 3, 6, and 8 as they can take a lot of time. Read ahead so that you don't get trapped by your decisions in project 6.",

Lectures took a surprising amount of time, because there are both canvas videos and also videos of Professor Balch in classroom, which I always fast-forwarded because he was slow at talking. Each week was 2-3 hours of lecture videos before the assignments.\nExams -  Exam 1 they provide questions for you, although they include things that aren't on the exam, and grill you on annoying python syntax. Exam 2 they don't provide much.\nProjects - were EXTREMELY inconsistent. We had weekly assignments in the summer class, and it totally caught me off guard about how difficult week 3 was (Decision trees) as compared with projects 1 & 2. For context...our assignments were due every Sunday. On some assignments, I could complete it post work between Monday - Thursday, with lectures. For half the weeks, I didn't finish until Sunday night.\nHw 1 - 6.5 hours, Easy\nHw 2 - 8.5 hours, Easy-Medium\nHw 3 - 26 hours. Hard. Decision Trees, Random Forests, Bag Learners, Insane Learners. This one was just hard because it shocked me with the level of work in a week.\nHw 4 - 3 hours, Easy\nHw 5 - 6.25 hours, Easy\nHw 6 - 22.25 hours , Medium. Technical Indicators analysis. This required the most finance research, and this locks you in for your Hw8 final strategy. I lost time on this by misunderstanding the lecture video, which did not like up for Hw6, and basically starting the hw8 trading strategy\nHw 7  - 20 hours, Hard. Q Learning, Dynamic Q learning. Reinforcement learning was a lot to wrap my mind around.\nHw 8 - 24 hours , Medium. Build a strategy with either Decision tree or Q Learner, combine with technical indicators\nSome of these assignments required a report, which took a shocking amount of time to get right. I felt about an average student in the class. I got full 100% marks on my code and would still get only an 85-90 on my report because they nitpick.\nHomework guidelines - are extremely hard to navigate. They give you so much information, and you have to look all over the project website, plus 1-5 piazza pages with hundreds of messages.\nTA's - Can be pretty condescending, so can other students in the class.\nOverall, a pretty good class, that was often fine, but had a really inconsistent level of work. I tried to work ahead, but TAs would only start to answer questions in the week of the assignment.",

You will learn Decision tree, random forest, bag learner,   Q learner and so on. You will apply them on analysis stock market data. You will also learn some financial knowledge from this course. There are mid-term and Final exams. Sample exams and questions are provided. If you learn these material pretty well, A is guaranteed. Instructor of this course is highly responsible. He cares about students feeling and suggestions, tries to improve learning experience. The grading speed is the fastest I've ever seen among all OMSCS courses I've taken so far. The instructor leads a team of highly efficient TAs. Very interesting project leads to real life application - some students even tried to applied it on year 2020 stock market. The extra credit project provided too little points but requires lots of time.",

Carefully look at the piazza FAQ posts and the grading templates of the projects.\nFor exams, study the practice Qs for each exam and you should be fine.\nThis course can be paired with another or taken during summer.\nTip: If you are on windows- try and install WSL, pycharm, and anaconda so you have less environment issues and can run pytest. Their pytest setup doesn't seem to work on windows. I didn't do it and it's not too much trouble to work around it but it would have saved me some time.

            review: "For a course where the original professor (Dr. Balch) is unavailable and has been taken over by another professor (Dr. Joyner), ML4T does a great job of running itself with the pre-recorded lectures and mostly pre-defined projects. I came to this course having already taken AI and ML and didn't care much about stock trading, but was interested in further developing my data science skills. As soon as I started, however, I realized that this material is very engaging and relevant to someone with even a passing interest in finances and ML. Actually, I should have taken this course before AI and ML because the lectures start you off with the basics in handling data in Python with numpy and pandas, which are heavily used in the other courses.\nThe projects are very enjoyable and could be useful in the long-term were you to apply what you learned to finding a job at a hedge fund or in FinTech. I actually used these skills to write a simple program to help allocate funds in my retirement portfolio. I really liked how the lectures broke concepts down into simple and easily digestible pieces, and though they sometimes lacked depth you could always continue by taking the courses mentioned above or diving in where your interests lie. The most demanding part of the course is the schedule - 8 projects due every two weeks (in a Fall/Spring semester), which all build on each other. While you can work ahead to some extent, I never did so myself, and keep in mind that details can change up until two weeks before each project start date. There is also a midterm and a final, which are multiple choice and can be somewhat tricky. It's totally doable to take this with another course of similar difficulty while working full-time, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it if you anticipate another global pandemic or family issues.\nIt could be helpful to read More Money Than God before or during the semester to get a background biography on hedge funds and notable investors, but you don't need to. The TAs can come off as a little rude at times, just make sure you've read the project directions thoroughly and watched the material before asking questions. Overall I enjoyed the course.",

You can really get ahead of assignments in this class if you want or need that flexibility.\nExams are straight forward if you've listened to lectures and reading the book just reinforces the concepts.\nI would recommend this as a must take for any major if you have any interest in ML or trading.",

(Or if you want to have a more relaxed semester, you can totally take this alone.)\nThis is a very high level introduction to Machine Learning concepts and trading stocks. For a ML noob like me, this was a great place to start. However, if you're already familiar with ML concepts, I don't know how helpful of a class this will be for you since it really just goes over basic learners, NumPy, Pandas, and Python.\nThe projects are all overall conceptually pretty easy to grasp. Professor Balch has an hour long tutorial that goes over how to implement the project, so just watch that and follow along and you can probably get the coding portions done for projects in <10 hours. Some of the projects are also paired with reports, and I found that those took significantly longer because you really have to give thoughtful responses.\nOverall, a very fun, light course. The lectures are pretty straightforward.",

            review: "ML4T was my 4th class in the program, after taking KBAI, IIS, and HCI, and surprisingly I found it to rank among the best. I don't have a particular interest in trading, but I heard that ML4T is a good warm-up for ML, so I decided to give it a shot.\nMy favorite thing about the course is how un-stressful it is compared to other courses. You have the projects pretty far in advance, and the due dates are very generous. One project took about 2 hours to complete, and it was allotted two weeks in the schedule. The lecture videos are given by Dr. Balch, not Dr. Joyner as I expected, but for the most part they are straightforward, comprehensible, and concise. It is very easy to keep up-to-date with lectures. There are no quiz grades, participation peer feedback, homework grades, or other things that demand your attention; just focus on completing the projects and taking the 2 exams when they occur, and it's smooth sailing.\nThe projects themselves are nothing too stressful, either. The most difficult thing to me was getting my setup such that I could use the Buffet servers for testing, which was a bit of a headache that took a few days. But once that was done, the projects were pretty focused python exercises that illustrated concepts from the lectures. A few of them required reports, a few were just autograded, but none took an exorbitant amount of time. The last two projects are very cool, as you make a QLearner and use it to simulate trading in the market. You should be aware, however, that the 8 projects make up almost all of your final grade, so there's little room for error. Luckily, I found the grading to be very generous. Exams are closed-notes and only 30 questions, but they're broad conceptual questions that I think reasonably assess your learning; they're not the extremely picky questions that deal with semantics from KBAI.\nOverall, this was a great course that allows you to learn some cool stuff about ML and trading without pulling your hair out or dealing with tight deadlines. Probably suitable for a first course or a summer course. Also TAs were especially good this semester, which helped.",

Some of the requirements in reports is quite tedious and time consuming.\nI was not clear on what I could / should do to answer questions on the first project. It's not weighted heavily, but in hindsight I could have worked a lot less and gotten a much better grade.\n\nOverall, I liked the class. It was easy, mainly because you can work ahead and the videos help you with many of the projects. However, there is lots of space to learn and grow. If you put in the hours of researching, studying, and improving your code, you can do some things you're proud of. If you want to skate by and do the minimum at the last minute (sadly some people like this like to brag as if that were an honor, which it isn't), you can still do well enough and get your easy preferred grade. If you're new to python (like the folks not in OMS), it is surely not an easy class.\nA couple of the take away's are learning about and how to make a Decision Tree and Random \"Forest\" classifier. You also learn about Q learners. The last few projects all tie together into the final project. This is a lot of work, but it's pretty nice (if) when it comes together.",

            review: "Short answer: it is a wonderful course filled with many beautiful parts. I would strongly recommend anyone who wants to have a good personal financial life to take this course, but your mileage may vary.\nFrom Reddit and all, people have had many misunderstandings about this course. They think this course is:\n\nEasier version of Machine Learning\nAdvanced ML application on Trading\n\nThis course tries to do a lot, and hence the above misunderstandings. In result, the course attracts:\n\npeople who wants simple course\npeople who wants to learn machine learning, but don't want to put work towards the Machine Learning course\npeople who knows machine learning already and wants to do trading\n\nWhich are not the ideal students of the designed course.\nThe course is split into 3 parts, called mini-course:\nMC1) Gentle Introduction to Pandas\nMC2) Gentle Introduction to Finance\nMC3) Gentle Introduction to applying ML to Trading\nIn 2020, this makes ML4T feels like a wannabe course that tries to do everything but did nothing good. People criticize it is too easy, people criticize it has too many finance, and learned nothing to start earning money by applying ML to trading.\nTo understand the reasoning behind the structure, we will have to first go back to 2013, when the OMSCS started. In those days, a lot of courses are split into 3 parts, which is what you are seeing at, the mini-courses structure. Machine learning isn't mainstream yet, and Python is loved by many, but still skeptically avoided by professors worldwide. Let alone Numpy and Pandas.\nMC1 was a revolution, that tried to push Python and its powerful data science libraries, Pandas and Numpy to mainstream, as opposed to Matlab and R or other languages. ML4T tried to justify that Python is the tool for trading and AI, it worked. It also introduced the essential graph plotting techniques and etc required to finish the later projects.\nBut of course in 2020, instead of people never touching Python, nowadays a lot of students knew Python already, and hence making MC1 felt like a worthless addition to the course. Personally, I feel the same way, and thought MC1 is quite outdated, and there is a need to revamp MC1. But again, would you like a course that ask you to plot graphs and never telling you how, or at least spend 2 weeks hand holding you the basics?\nFor MC2, since we are OMSCS students, a lot of us would prefer to do computer science instead of finance, and those that don't like finance will never like it. If you don't like finance, ask why did you chose this course in the beginning? So my advice is to disregards those reviews that say finance part is too heavy, the problem lies within the students themselves.\nIn MC2, you will go through the concepts of a book written by Prof. Balch. It is a short book that covers the essentials of trading in general, mixed in with interesting hedge fund stories. It has been a great reading experience.\nBut of course, the finance part are mostly optional, because you can probably finish the project without knowing any finance, but again, why do you choose this course from the beginning? If you do not at all read the book and the papers and just cheat your way out of the projects, why are you in OMSCS? They say what you get out of OMSCS is what you gave into it, it's very true in the case of ML4T.\nIt is said that money is never enough for professionals, so we see news like couples bringing half a million a year and still feeling that it is not enough. This occurs because of the lack of personal finance knowledge, which most of us never learned. MC2 won't cover personal finance, but learning how to stock market works, has filled a big hole in my personal finance learning journey.\nMC3 teaches you Ensembles and Q-Learning. I mean, come on, AlphaGo was 2016 and before that Reinforcement Learning was widely looked down upon. Ensembles was the way to go to win Kaggle competitions. And this course brought all of them, all in 2013. ML4T is amazing.\nIn 2020, the course feels like a good gap and introduction to OMSCS, with a little Python, and a little finance, and a little Machine Learning. You can treat it however you want, but for me it has been an amazing ride through the course.\nFor Professor Balch and Joyner, I think there is a need to revamp the course, particularly the lectures, to update it to 2020.\n\nPython is now mainstream, so ML4T should include the latest stable Pandas and Numpy APIs, particularly the tricks that data scientists use everyday. It is possible to completely remove MC1 from this course and expand MC2 and MC3, which probably would make this a course that is generally taken before ML to become a ML application course that could be generally taken after ML. I personally think that the no-MC1 structure would be better for 2020 and so on.\nMC2 covers the book 75%, it would be better if the book is covered back-to-back, and updated with new insights Professor Balch learned while building the AI team at JPMorgan.\nEnsembles and Q-Learning are now well understood. There have been quite a lot of advancements since then, so it would be cool to include new types of Ensembles, as well as new improvements to Q-Learning like modern experience replay, and if possible, Deep Q-Learning.\n",

The instructor hadn't changed the homework assignments from the prior term, and would assign them and then change them days before the due date. While they weren't particularly difficult, everyone was running their code on the autograder on the weekend it was due, severely bogging down the server so you'd often wait 1-2 hours before getting results. While the instructor said that the assignments would only have small changes, when you work full time you have to dedicate time to do the assignments and going back to edit them means finding more time. Eventually I gave up in disgust and quite trying, and never bothered to enroll in any more courses. You really do get what you pay for, and the low price is strongly correlated to the quality of education.",

            review: 'This was my fifth course in the program, and it was one of my favorites.  I really enjoyed how direct and to the point the lectures were without overcomplicating the material.  I also liked the fact that the professor provided supplementary videos that guided the students on how to tackle projects.  A big portion of this course is getting familiar with numpy and pandas.  Another big portion of the course is getting insight on hedge funds, and other types of funds, and how they try to use mathematical equations and fundamental and technical analysis to find ways to beat the market.  A final portion of the class is learning about basic ML algorithms such as Q-learners and Random forests, and gaining insight on how they can be used to make trading decisions.  For many of the projects you have to write reports that are worth a significant portion of the project grade, and you can even get 1 or 2 extra credit points on a report if you put in the time to thoroughly analyze your results.  I enjoyed how the online students were lumped together with the on campus students.  My biggest complaint is there are a lot of details in the instructions that are easy to miss but can impact your grade on a project quite a bit, so always read the directions carefully.  For example, you could lose 10-20 points for forgetting to put your name.  Staying active on slack is very helpful, because people will often point out important points in the directions that you might miss.\nUnfortunately, you will most likely not learn enough from this class alone to apply machine learning strategies in real life situations, but the class will give you a strong foundation if you are interested in exploring that field.',

            review: "I liked the course overall but definitely think it has more potential than what's actually being done. I rated it medium because really most of the projects took me around 6 hours to complete. Which I really don't think is bad. There were really only two projects that took around 8-10 hours to complete so in the end I rated it medium because most of the projects were. On average with assignments and lectures (plus the occasional reading), I would say it took me around 12 hours a week. That's on the high side again given that homework is due usually every other week. That being said here's the review. The course is really split into two sections. The front half is a lot of stock and market information with hands on Python assignments to supplement the learning. The latter half of the course is more machine learning in conjunction with Python and stock and finances. You don't need to be an experience python user to take this course. Though I did have experience using the Python libraries and Python is a language I program in every day so it will certainly help. Also, you don't have to be a stock expert. The lectures are straightforward an well laid out in nice manageable chunks. In fact most were 1 hour lectures I could easily do during my lunch if I wanted. The profession is very knowledgeable, funny, and a good presenter; you'll enjoy watching the lectures. This class really glances over a few machine learning algorithms and you'll program a few but I wouldn't say it's a full deep dive into Machine Learning. In fact it's really about using algorithms to trade stocks and manage portfolios. This of course makes it solid intro class. There were of course some drawbacks. Communications throughout the semester was terrible. Reddit was used instead of Piazza for this semester which I think threw a lot of non-reddit users through a loop. I happen to use it often but it made the threads really noisy and messy with people asking numerous redundant questions and not putting comments in the right threads. Additionally, communication from the professor was far and few between. Assignment \"updates\" or comments about questions in the reddit threads (which could easily grow in the few thousands) were fair game for requirements on assignments (even if not listed on the rubric). Assignments were hardly finalized until a 3-5 days before their due date and portals to submit were often times opened days before they were actually due. My TA was impossible to get ahold of throughout the semester. The assignments tended to have subtle but time consuming changes that needed to happen each week (one week give the output in this dataframe and the next is needs to be a series or another datatype). This wouldn't be bad overall if two things happened. 1. There was a blip or sample of what the output should look like. 2. Each week you weren't forced to retool your other classes and functions to accommodate the returns to be some new data type for the input of a new function. Overall, the factors above speak for themselves. I found the course engaging and entertaining enough to give it a Liked, I didn't spend forever on it each week, and it was fairly average difficulty wise.",

            review: "As others have said, the course seems to have been revamped some to make it more difficult now than it was in the past. It's not horrible but don't go in thinking it's one of the easiest courses in the program, it's not. There's a lot of good in the course but it currently suffers from poor execution and a lack of communication making the course way more stressful than it needs to be.\nThe lecture material is good, the assignments themselves are relevant and have the right level of challenge. Unfortunately most of the assignments were not released when they were expected to be. Assignments would be released in \"beta\" form a few days or even a week after we were expected to start them. and then sometimes not \"finalized\" until a few days before the assignment was due. This is troublesome because some of these assignments do need the full allotted time to work on them, and if you waited until an assignment was \"finalized\" you would pretty much guarantee that you don't have enough time to finish the assignment. This wouldn't be as bad if it were minor tweaks being made, but the \"beta\" version was typically just the previous semesters assignment and there was no clear communication on what changed with each iteration of the assignment so you are left analyzing every line of the assignment over and over to make sure you don't miss some gotcha that could cause you to lose substantial points.\nThis is my 9th OMSCS course and this course in its current form isn't very friendly to OMSCS students who typically have full-time jobs and other responsibilities outside of school. In addition to the above issues, assignments also were not open for submission until a day or two before the due date in many cases. So even if you had worked ahead, you  still would need to plan around having an internet connection and submitting your assignment the day it was due. There were also random participation checks on the forums, punishing students who didn't check every day. In general it is structured in a way that prevented students planning around their life, and instead they must plan their life around the course. Most OMSCS courses I've taken have been more flexible in this regard. Students who suggested changes to the course to improve it were met with snarky comments from the professor on the forums.\nIn general I can't recommend the course in its current form unless your willing to deal with the above headaches. There plenty of much better run OMSCS courses.",

There were also TAs without the "Piazza Instructor" badge, so it was confusing to see who was what.\n\nOn the bright side, it an easy A and the workload except for Project 3 is pretty manageable (start early on that one!).

            review: "I have mixed feelings for this class. I've heard people saying this class is very easy, and looking at the reviews most OMSCS students rated it as easy or very easy. But like the other OMSA students who wrote reviews here, I did not feel it was easy at all. I would have rated it as hard if there were not so much information online that we could reference to.\nThe first obstacle was to log in Buffet and run the scripts from there. I had no knowledge in SSH and I guess the teachers thought everyone had CS background and did not provide any step by step instructions. Luckily a student drafted an instruction and posted on Piazza which saved me from struggling.\nThe second obstacle for me was writing the code from scratch in an IDE. I've taken CSE 6040 earlier this year and I did very well in it and got familiar with python and Jupyter Notebook. That class was designed to help us learn python step by step. Even though, I still found it hard to code from scratch. And the assignment descriptions are long and confusing.\nHowever, the exams are easy, thanks to the question pools. I did pretty well in the exams even though I didn't really understand some of the concepts.\nI do agree that with this class you can get an easier A than some other classes. But for OMSA students who are not so experienced with python, I think this is not an easy class if you want to learn a lot and you need to keep that in mind when deciding which classes to pair with.",

            review: 'Background: my first course that required coding in the program (previous course HCI) - and non-CS undergrad - so limited ability to compare directly with other courses in terms of difficulty. I had plenty of familiarity with pandas and some numpy before the course, and this course definitely rounded out my knowledge of and experience with numpy. This course was administered by Prof. Joyner as Prof. Balch was on leave during this iteration of the course.\nExpectations and requirements are clearly defined at the start. I really enjoyed the subject matter, and had some domain knowledge about finance coming in. The projects are the majority of the grade and are very appropriate to motivate the subject matter and allow for a well-rounded understanding of the material. Projects had a great balance of starter template code provided and required solution formats vs room for creativity.\nFor me, the mean time spent on this course per week is not very representative of the range of time per week - around projects 3, 6, and 8 I spent significant time - sometimes 20-30 hrs/wk, and in some weeks only 3-8 hrs/wk.',

            review: "My background coming in: knew Pandas already for my job, didn't know anything at all about finance or machine learning\nAlright on to the actual review...\nProjects: Course had 8 projects, very widely ranging in difficulty. One literally took 1 hour, and one took me 25 hours and caused severe eye strain lol (hello assess_learners-- start that one early!). The last project (strategy_learner) wasn't as bad at all, maybe I was expecting a repeat of what was me trying to figure out assess_learners (was pretty terrible at getting the concepts for that one). Also I may or may not have skipped the dyna part on qlearning_robot just because spending 5 hours for 5% of that grade vs. the 1 hour I'd already spent for 95% of the grade wasn't worth it, I'm a really lazy student sadly).  Not sure I'd recommend this as a summer course as that'd be one project a week and doing assess_learners in a week would've been terrible.\nExams: Midterm is legit a repeat of the practice exam, and final was tougher but I still didn't study much and got a pretty good grade (and I'm terrible at test taking, trust me). Taking notes on the lectures helped me digest the content.\nLectures: Make sure you watch the lectures (especially the recorded Youtube ones where Professor Balch is speaking to a classroom) as they walk you through the assignments.\nExtra Credit: If you're feeling adventurous and for some reason have 20+ hours of freetime despite being in grad school part-time and likely working a full-time job (lol) go for it. Personally for me and a lot of others it wasn't worth the hassle for the limited amount of credit.\nOverall the course was fair, but you need to be absolutely detail-oriented when submitting projects (some of them are literally worth a letter grade and a half!!). Run the code on buffet, double check your file submissions, and put effort into the corresponding report (if applicable) and you'll be fine.",

To prepare for the class, practice numpy slicing and vectorization (including somewhat advanced ones like unstack, groupby etc). Professor Balch\'s lectures are excellent.

            review: "A lot of the other reviews paint the picture that this class is a complete cinch. It might be for people in OMSCS, but for those of us in Analytics it might not be quite as easy...keeping in mind many of us don't have the computing background to pursue a master's in comp sci! I felt it was reasonably difficult, but not impossible.\nThere are eight homeworks, which comprise about 3/4 of your grade. Many of the homeworks build on each other, like you're to reference old projects and reuse old code. They're exclusively in Python - if you did well in CSE 6040 (for my fellow OMSA students) you'll probably be good enough in Python to do well in this course. If you didn't, I'd advise against taking it. The homeworks all require you to pass grading scripts that they openly share with you - to run the grading scripts you need to connect into a remote server and write some code using Unix. You don't technically have to do this - your assignments are turned in through Canvas -  but neglecting to do so would be a terrible idea, as you won't know if your code passed or not. So I'd advise going in, knowing a decent chunk of Unix code on top of Python. A few of us struggled to get off the ground with Unix, at first. Each homework has Python code to turn in, some of the more involved assignments also have reports of your findings as well. The homeworks are extremely inconsistent with how much work they are, and they're weighted differently for that reason. Anywhere from 3-15% of your total grade.\nThe exams are multiple choice and center mainly around the lectures, which go about teaching us financial terms and what different types of ML models are. The exams are also only 25% of the grade, total. If you've already taken ISYE 6501 all of the models should be review, though the ins and outs of programming said models in Python, as well as the finance behind it, will likely be new for you.\nAll in all I'd say it was one of the better classes I've taken.",

            review: "This class was not too hard but there were a lot of ways you could meet your own downfall, as mentioned in the course slack (not submitting a file, leaving plt.show() in, etc). So mostly, be sure to read the 'what to turn in' section and the rubric heavily. You might also need to read some of the project descriptions multiple times because they don't really make sense and you just have to get through them. Also, be sure to test your autograders with different seeds (when applicable) because you might be surprised to see your code scores if you don't.\nAll that aside, my biggest qualm with this course is the general laziness in how it's run. Dr. Joyner is great (10/10 would recommend other courses with him) but this class isn't really his priority so it's mostly left to the TAs/self-maintained. The TAs can be really snarky, give half-answers to questions, marking things are resolved on Piazza when they aren't, or in general just not answering questions at all. The most frustrating way this materialized was that for the exams, they gave you these 'Study Guides' and most of them are outdated (i.e. do not align with the syllabus) so they included information that we either never learned or that were on the other exam. It seems like they just do a copy paste from semester to semester of the course page and call it good, which is highly disappointing. They did provide question banks but they are truly the worst resource that I have ever had in a course. The questions were submitted by previous students and are full of typos, questions without answers, duplicates, and questions that aren't even fully there and cut off halfway or one of them even finishes off in Chinese. I find all of this extremely lazy on the part of the teaching staff. Yes, they are not required to give us a question bank but if they're going to, why not make it somewhat useful...There is a quizlet for the final that is helpful (and narrows down the 700+ questions to 241).\nOverall, this class isn't hard and not too time consuming but I think it could be heavily improved. Personally, I'm disappointed that I spent one of my ten courses on ML4T, especially when compared to the four other awesome courses I have taken.",

            review: "This is probably the best course that I have taken in OMSCS so far. The quality of the lectures and the projects were extremely good. Tucker Balch has a very logical way of explaining the theories and ideas behind many of the concepts that you will learn. Then, he actually goes and explains how to implement it in code. Soon after these lectures, a project will be assigned where the lectures apply directly to the course material. This is the best part of the class, as it feels like you are always learning and applying your skills. (unlike many other courses, cough Knowledge Based AI cough)\nThe projects themselves have an autograder (for the most part) and can give you a nice fuzzy feeling that you will get a decent grade. There are two or three projects that are somewhat difficult and time consuming, and you will need to spend a fair amount of time translating the lecture material into raw code. These assignments are the ones you learn the most from and are well worth the effort. (Decision Tree Learner, Manual Strategy, StrategyLearner)\nThere are also a midterm and a final which will be no problem, and study guides of questionable quality (well. the final one anyways).\nThere are a few improvements that could be made:\n-For one, there are some lectures by Tucker Balch that were recorded as live classroom sessions. These contain a lot of wasted time getting screens to work, saying hello to the class, and repeated material. Play these sessions at 2x to save yourself some time.\n-The TA's this semester were very quick to respond, but 90% of the time just pointed right back to the syllabus and could be a bit snarky. If someone is asking for clarification on something, it usually helps to rephrase the answer rather than repeat the same thing you just said. Kind of an obvious part of communication, but it was a problem.\n-Final exam study guide is an ugly mess of unanswered questions and one question was in Chinese!\nOverall though, this was an excellent class and I found myself pleasantly surprised by not only the machine learning material but also the trading.\nPS: Watch the movie the Big Short that is required for the class: it's actually pretty interesting and will make you angry at Wall Street.",

The only issue I had with one of the project (P3) was it's weight of 15%. I felt like I spent way more time on the latter projects, yet P3 was weighted more than the latter projects.\nI thought the lecturers were well organized and gave enough detail and examples to progress through the projects and exams.\nRegarding the tests, reviewing the previous practice exams helped prepare me for them a lot, and so you should definitely make time to look over the sample questions.\nLastly there wasn't much activity from the TAs on Piazza. I often found questions unanswered, and quite frustrating when trying to get an answer. I focused my communication via Slack.",

Prof. Joyner is the teaching head, but he doesn't do much besides posting weekly updates.\nThe lectures were very fun for me as someone who had no idea about the financial world and how to code in Python (my background being purely Java).

The projects were rated in terms of difficulties by the professor so you could plan accordingly as to how much time you should allocate for that project. The tests weren't that hard as long as you studied. I also found it incredibly helpful to go over the sample test questions. I definitely found some of the projects hard and it was a grind some weeks, but I'm glad I took the course.",

The exams are not that hard (at all) and fully covered by lectures and mostly on the question bank which is available for everyone from the beginning of the course. The projects can be worked ahead. I've spent more time on writing reports then writing codes. Some of them are no brainer and following the project lecture video is sufficient to get good scores. There is no bonnie auto-grader but provided test scripts are sufficient to get some feeling about the final grades. There are lots of very detailed rubrics though which should be checked carefully not to miss any points.\nI took this in Summer and it was very condensed and therefore moved very fast - projects due in almost every week. if I had took this in Spring/Fall, it might be very relaxing one or good to be taken with other class.",

Piazza is strictly used in this course and I felt it could have been better with the use of Slack so, while the TAs are pretty good about responding, don't expect the same quick help you could get on Slack from other students.\nIf you just keep up with the lectures / reading with the schedule you will likely get an A.  It's very doable to get ahead on the work as well if you need to plan around personal commitments.  Great introduction to Python as well if you have never coded in it before.\nOverall a great class and would recommend!",

Dr. Balch doesn't immediately give off a very professorial vibe (no offense), but after I got used to his style, I realized that he is a very good teacher. Programming a decision tree and a Q-learner by hand was pretty cool and I am excited to learn more about ML in future courses. Taking it during the summer was a bit difficult on the time management side. Some homeworks were pretty easy and only took a few hours. Others involved reports and took 4-5+ times as long. I think in the spring and fall some assignments are 2 weeks long, while in the summer they are all 1 week long. It would have helped me a lot to know ahead of time which assignments are 2 weeks long in the spring or fall so I could get a head start on them in the summer. I definitely had some time management issues on some of the longer HWs, not because I didn't realize they'd be more work, but because I didn't realize how much more work they would be.",

The projects are very straightforward (with the great resources from the lectures and additional videos) and are helpful, but I think the lectures could be a bit more substantial and present more ML and financial theory, considering the light pace of this class (even during the summer).',

It also contained some pretty interesting content on financial analysis of the market and stock trading as well. Also as a side note, Prof. Balch no longer teaches the course - instead Prof Joyner taught for the Spring 2019 semester (though Balch's video lessons were still used), so I'm not sure who will continue to teach the class in the future and if / when its content and materials will be refreshed.

            review: "I really really disliked this course. I rated as neutral instead of strongly disliked because the class was reasonably well run and my dislike was mostly due to lack of interest in the subject. I took this class as prep for ML because I have very little machine learning experience, but the class didn't really go any deeper into ML concepts and more of the lectures are related to finance. I think you should only take this class if you're really interested in trading. (I probably had no business taking this class because turns out I find it so painfully boring.)\nOverall the course was the easiest I've taken so far. There were assignments due roughly every other week.  Some assignments took a few hours and some I spent about 45 minutes on. (I had some experience with python, but I'm pretty new to pandas.) The hardest/most annoying part of the course was having to solve algebraic equations in your head because pencil and paper aren't allowed during the exams.",

The projects are open to at the start of the term and you can breeze through them quickly. However do make sure to go through each of the asks for each project. A few misses and you get dinged hard with penalties. There are 2 exams 35 minutes long, there is a question bank and you'd get a lot of inputs from the forums. I would recommend taking notes during the videos and go through them prior to the exams. Overall a great class, TAs are great and do respond quickly. Specifically Tala who was the all star TA for Spring 2019.",

            review: 'Great course. Well organized and TAs are pretty quick at grading. Projects and Exams are well in sync with the material provided and so getting an A is pretty straight forward if you are thorough with the projects because projects have minor details which if you miss will be a problem. Though nothing out of the ordinary because everything is well documented in the class. Professor Joyner took over the class this semester so overall the class was expected to be well run anyway. Some of the technical stuff in the class needs some polishing like grading scripts that would be a good idea if they were setup on a server instead of giving it out to students because that adds more human error to things like submissions. But it will probably be fixed anyway given the demand and scale at which it is run and will be run in the future. This is one class that needs to be on every students list doing OMSCS.',

It starts with a nice probability refresher, and builds up the knowledge towards experimenting and building some of your own data structures than, then, can be used to achieve real-world results.\nIt doesn't delve too much in theory, but that's a good thing, actually. You can always take ML or RL after that to go in more depth.\nAn overall excellent introduction, with the added spice of the trading projects, which let people take a look at a very interesting part of modern finance.",

ML4T is my first exposure to machine learning (Computing Systems specialization) and it has piqued my interest to continue learning in this area.\nIf you took this course first or early in your OMSCS career, you have been spoiled! Fastest I have seen grading done, and excellent grading scripts to check your work (most classes don't have grading scripts). Most courses also don't provide past exams or quizlets as study guides. The TAs in this course are the most present, efficient and attentive I have seen.\nAnd Prof Balch's lectures are in a class by themselves--he made every aspect of the course approachable for the novice. Most other courses don't give you all the math you need along the way with minimal assumptions.\nIf you haven't taken a machine learning course before, start with this one.",

            review: "I think that this class is very well-designed and the material taught is very interesting. My major complaint about the course is the course administration. When I took the course there were a lot of students enrolled so naturally, the TAs try to leverage automatic grading scripts on the assignments. If you follow the instructions perfectly then you'll be fine but from my experience, the TAs are not well-equipped to deal with a submission that slightly veers from the instructions. The original instructor is no longer teaching the course, so all grade conflicts had to be dealt with by the TAs. \nI will relay an unforutnate personal experience that led me to need to drop the course even though I just got a 94 on the midterm and felt like I had a strong grasp on all of the assignments I had done. THey want you to use a helper file called util.py to standardize how everyone reads in the data. The only benefit this util.py file serves is to standardize the grading; I could have written the functions myself but they want us to use their code. Anyways, I misread a line in the five page project description saying not to change utils.py and when I ran into a bug, I changed the code in util.py to fix the bug. (I could have easily changed my code instead of util.py but did not read that I wasn't allowd to change util.py so I didn't think it made a difference).  Because of this, when I submitted the assignment none of the tests passed on their system because they used their version of util.py instead of the changed one I have. All of the tests passed on my system and I put hours into the assignment. My automatic grade for the assignment which is %12 of my grade was a 0 because none of the tests passed due to this syntax error which occurred at the beginning of the script because of that change I made in util.py. When I received my grade of a 0 I was shocked because I thought I would get a 100. I investigated and realized that the issue stemmed from my changing one line in my local version of util.py. I informed the TAs and asked for a re-grade with either my version of util.py or to let me update my code with their version of util.py. I found it completely unreasonable to not grade any of my work due to a silly syntax error which could be fixed in a few minutes. \nThe TAs were unreasonable and maintained that I would still get a grade of 0; the same grade you get for not doing any work. They didn't read any of my code to give partial credit or give me an opportunity to resubmit my code for a late penalization. I couldn't speak to an instructor because he no longer teaches the course. Because I received this grade right before the withdrawal deadline, I had to drop because I couldn't risk having this 0 stand and then get less than a B in the course.\nI program in python professionally for my job and I have never withdrawn from a course before in my entire academic career. This whole experience was very unfortunate, and it is putting me one semester behind in completing the program. This situation would have never happened in an in-person class. I think it is indicative that the TAs don't provide personal attention to grades and rely to heavily on automated scripts. If OMSCS can't provide personal attention to its students for large classes then this is a flaw in the program.\nIf you follow the instructions exactly then you won't run into this issue, but if you don't follow the exact instructions then it doesn't seem like they are equipped to properly manage such a large class.\n\nIt is unfortunate that I had such a bad experience with the TAs because everything else about the course is great. I think they should review the TAs in this course; as it stands they're no better than robots. They follow the grading script to the T and literally give you a 0 for a syntax error that could be fixed with a single line of code. I would expect graduate level TAs to have enough common sense and empathy to be able to look past an automatic grading script when there is a flaw with it.",

And the final project put it all together.\nThe TAs were extremely on top of things and grades came back quickly. If you pay attention, take notes, and use the study guides, the exams are also quite easy.\nI would highly recommend this course to everyone. Definitely my favorite so far!",

Professor Balch was active on Piazza and so were the TAs. Apart from the official lectures on Udacity, there were several youtube recordings where Prof. Balch explains about most the projects. These videos were really helpful.\nThere were two proctored tests. One for the mid-term and the other for the final. There was sufficient material provided (collected by old students and TAs) for the mid-term. No material was provided exclusively for the final. However, if you've done the projects with all sincerity and watched the lectures, the finals is not a big deal.\nI would suggest not to lose steam since it's a relatively easier course. If you lose a few credits in a couple of assignments you might not end up with an A.\nI lost a couple of points in one of the project reports and not so perfect scores in the exams and I risked myself of not getting an A.

I felt that not only was the instructor a fun person, he also did an incredible job teaching concepts in a way I could understand.  For example, I took AI and they covered decision trees and it kind of made sense but I struggled with it.  This class also went over decision trees and I feel like it made complete sense after one lecture.  Maybe I benefited from having already been introduced, but in the AI class I watched those lectures multiple times to no avail, and I got it first try in this class.  So kudos to the teacher on that.\nOnly thing I would recommend be different is that there be a little more focus on the machine learning and a little less on the trading, but the class is machine learning for training and there is a separate machine learning class, so I guess its not a big deal.  I felt like I ended up learning only a tiny bit about machine learning and how it applied to trading, but I learned a lot about trading.  So if you were more interested in trading anyway, this is the class for you!',

The midterm exam had mostly minor permutations of the sample exams. The learning experience is significantly degraded because the TA guidance is severely lacking, confusing, and self-contradictory.  While they respond quickly to most questions, often the response is unsatisfactory and unclear. An example, after our midterms were graded, we were provided only a score.  Only after a student posted to request to see our exam to know what we got wrong did a TA reply with "ask your grader TA" response. It shouldn\'t take additional action on our part to see our exam. Furthermore, even after recycling so many past midterm questions, the midterm still had out-of-scope questions and questions with incorrect answers. It is also implied that these questions will remain if a student doesn\'t contact the TA about their midterm. This is incredibly sloppy, and just one example of many blunders with how this class is now conducted. There are too many other excellent classes in this program than to waste your time, money, and effort on this one.',

The course does a good job teaching some basics at the start, but you will have to ramp up fast.\nVideos are all quite good, I thoroughly enjoyed it all.\nThe only quibble I have is that the course takes awhile to \"Finalize\" the projects, so it's somewhat hard to work ahead.  That being said, you can certainly work ahead, just be ready to make minor changes.  All the projects are available from the start of the course with detailed instructions on the course site, it's just they get tweaked as the course progresses.\nExams are fair -- make sure to study the provided materials -- they are highly relevant.\nOur final exam was drawn from a question bank of student written questions!  My question ended up on the exam!! I could not remember the answer!!! True story.\nTA's are very active, we had one god-mode TA who was literally always online and very kind.

            review: 'Projects are interesting and is a balance of finance and machine learning. It will strengthen your Python and Numpy skills. It is a wide range of difficulty but a ramp up. The Professor difficulty suggestion is subjective. I found that the two most difficult project was assess_learners(rated challenging) and manual_strategy(rated moderate). Assess_learners was challenging because of the assignment itself while manual strategy was difficult because the instructions were general and supporting material was limited. I would recommend to start on each project as early as possible as there is usually minor changes when the assignment is finalize.\nExams were easy because one was similar to a prior exam and the second one was based on the top rated student question pools which you had access too.\nOverall, great course material of projects and lectures. Very clear expectations on most assignments, professor was active, and the Teaching Assistants were outstanding. Remember to check Piazza discussion and the Slack Channel as the staff was great.',

            review: "Overall, this course was very good and is a great first course. The material was well thought out and the assignments are great. Below are my thoughts on different areas of the course.\nTests\nThe tests were honestly my least favorite part of this class. The first test was the midterm and we were given previous tests and their correct answers. Memorizing those was all you needed to do to get an A. For the final, we were asked to create a question on a specific subject in the course depending on our last name. After this, all of the questions that were student generated were sent out and we were required to grade 5 of them. Once this was over, the professor gave out all of the ratings. I studied the ones that had a score of 4+ and 3 or more ratings. This ended up being 250 questions. Doing this, I was able to get a 27/30 on the final. Overall, depending on your approach, the tests could have been more of a regurgitation of material rather than actual understanding of material. Not to say that memorizing these questions doesn't help with understanding of material. But, you get the point.\nTL;DR you can memorize material and do well\nAssignments\nThe assignments were great & had awesome documentation / resources on how to complete them. There were 8 assignments total ranging from easy to very challenging in difficulty. The difficulties were given on the course wiki & I found them to be accurate. The first few assignments were great for getting me up to speed in python. The later ones were more difficult and reinforced material learned in the lectures. The assignments do start to build on themselves, so do not get behind. I started all of them very early & was able to finish them days before the due date. This was good because they did have reports that you needed to write after finishing the code.\nTL;DR start them early & check piazza -> you'll do well.\nPiazza\nGood once you sorted through the countless duplicate posts. I had very little patience / empathy for people who continuously posted duplicate questions. Other than that, it was very active with good posts. The TAs & professor answered quickly and with good responses. If something comes off as offensive, don't take it personally. There are participation checks for Piazza. So make sure you're posting & reading posts through the app or website. Also, make sure you use the correct email in the settings. Your actual GaTech email, not the alias. Visit the site daily so you know where questions / answers are. This will be helpful and beneficial for projects.\nTL;DR read posts, ask questions, make sure your email is correct -> you'll do well.\nDo:\n\nWatch lectures - Udacity\nStart projects early\nPost on piazza\nStudy for exams early\n\nDon't:\n\nPOST DUPLICATES ON PIAZZA\nStart projects late. You have time. You always have time. Just. Do. It.\nForget to check piazza or wiki before asking a question\nAsk questions that you could easily search on piazza\nSay 'Sorry if this is a duplicate, but...' because you will get a response tagging another post with your question. The TA's don't have time for you inability to search. Seriously.\n",

            review: 'Best course so far that I took. I am only 3 courses in the program. The subject of finance and machine learning were both subjects that I have a strong interest, hence was making the class more smooth to take. I finished with a grade of 95% (A).\nHowever, even if I found the course interesting, it is far from being perfect.\nFirst of all, you won\'t be able to work in advance too much. Most of the time, the "final version" of the assignment are signed off 4-7 days before the date you need to submit. My schedule is challenging and I was able to rush at the middle of the semester but I had to come back to my assignments to do adjustment constantly.\nSecond, the class is okay but some lectures video quality are from many years ago, with a very bad recording (blurry) whiteboard. They could have re-recorded it, they did not. Hence, it looks cheap. There is plenty of Youtube video with better quality. Georgia Tech must stay in touch with reality and offer better materials.\nThird, the teacher will give you a single example of most concepts. Only one. You will have to find more online. It annoys me that they deliberately provide as little as possible instead of having the goal to provide the best way to teach. For example, the notions around DYNA is wrong. If you implement the algorithm described, you end up with timeout for the assignment. No explanation in the lesson about it, it was through Piazza that a student gave the reason.\nThe final exam was questions from students, a lot were bad qualities. Even if students had to vote on the best questions, it was still not okay. It also makes the whole class feel cheap. The teacher recycles content from many years ago and was not even there to write the final exam. Again, students pay for something that should be of better quality than what you can find online.\nI worked a lot on each assignment, way more than many people in the class. I was astonished to read student posting basic questions on the assignment with less than 24h before the submission while I already had worked 2-3 weeks on the assignment. I may not be as smart as these students, however, the level of the questions asked was basic, hence believe that some people are getting enough to pass the course without spending must time. I personally had to spend easily 20 hours per assignment. Most of the time was to understand the theory. Even if I watched all the lessons and read all the theory recommended, the implementation often puzzled me. Disclaimer: I have almost no experience in Python and Numpy/Pandas hence had to struggle a little for the first few assignments.\nFinally, instead of focusing on the machine learning part of trading, there were topics that were making no sense. For example, a lot of time spent on the crisis of 2008 with mortgages. Or, about option tradings. It does not belong in that class at all. These two parts must be taken off and have more examples, theory, applications in machine learning topics that were executed too fast.\nPros:\n\nSubject\nInteresting assignment\nGood class to tiptoes on machine learner and Python/Numpy/Pandas\nLectures were way better than my two first classes\nNo teamwork\nA mix of code and report\n\nCons:\n\nQuality of lesson\nAssignments are very slow to be sealed in requirement\nNot enough fat around the bones\nToo much offtopic subjects (like the movie, options trading)\nTwo 30 minutes exams\n\nI have spent too much time on that class.

            review: "Overall, I enjoyed this course.  This really feels like a combination MBA/CS course, so if you are looking for pure CS, this may not be for you.  I have not taken any of the other ML courses yet, which did not seriously impact my ability to get things done, so for most people the same thing should apply.  This course definitely got my excitement up for taking more ML courses!\nAs for the projects - if you are not a strong programmer they can be extremely challenging.  Do not come into this course expecting the opportunity to skill up from zero experience and be ready for later projects - you need a bit of familiarity with Python to get started, but the basic usage of NumPy and Pandas are covered in the lectures, but you're somewhat on your own figuring out how to make them work efficiently.  Make sure you use an IDE (such as PyCharm) that can help you effectively write and debug code.  In the Fall 2018 semester we were still using Python 2.7, and you must use specific packages for auto grading compatibility, but I believe Dr. Balch has stated they are working on getting to Python 3 and newer package versions soon.  Almost all code is auto graded, with the majority of test cases provided to you, with a few hidden cases (hidden in that you haven't been given the auto grading case, but the assignment directions will definitely point to edge cases you may need to consider). In addition, some of the projects have both code and reports that must be written, so if writing is not your thing, be aware.\nThe organization of this course was somewhat underdone, in that the course schedule wasn't finalized until about two weeks in, and most assignments were not finalized until about a week before their due date.  There were usually only minor changes, if any, from what the assignment page on the course wiki originally had, although the final project had some moderate changes.  This was the first time the course was on Canvas, so it may take a few semesters before things are running smoothly on Canvas.  The lectures on Udacity are usually watched out of order, and there are additional lectures/recorded office hours on YouTube that are required, so not everything is in one place.  In addition, you get to watch a movie for this class, \"The Big Short\", but have to procure it on your own - which is not a big deal, you can buy/rent it for streaming or a Blu-ray for less than most textbooks - but some were put off by the fact that they had to do this.\nThe exams were entirely hosted on ProctorTrack (as in, none of the exam content was delivered using Canvas).  That's a little annoying because I think Canvas provides a better test-taking experience for students.  The exams themselves were multiple choice, with about a minute per question budget (30 questions ≈ 35 minutes).  The content of the exams wasn't too difficult, and the second exam and crowdsourced from the students, which meant if you could memorize the questions, you could do very well on that exam.\nFinally, Piazza - this class had several sections combined into one Piazza section, and it was definitely messy.  There were nearly 2500 posts over the semester, and many of them were duplicate questions or questions that were being covered on a pinned post.  The course team did a pretty good job managing, and were very active in berating people who didn't look things up first.  Some might find that harsh but I think it's almost required in order to get people to change their behavior.\nOverall - the pace of this course was a bit rapid, but it covered a lot and accomplished a lot.  It may not have gone as deep for some, but again this is more of a survey and practical applications kind of course.  It's definitely a good appetizer if you are just getting started with machine learning.",

            review: 'I would highly recommend this course as a first course or a secondary course paired with a more difficult course. I completed this course along with ML. This course serves as an introduction to data manipulation with Python and Pandas and an introduction to a few basic machine learning concepts. If you have taken AI or CV before this one, then the projects will require no new learning with python at all except maybe how to graph data for some specific requirements. Similarly, you will not learn any meaningful depth if you have taken ML beforehand. Anyone gauging their interest into trading and financial software would benefit from this course. Anyone with experience with applying machine learning to trading will not learn anything new in this course.\nIn terms of structure, the course starts with simple projects manipulating data in Python. These projects become modules in later learning agents before using everything at the end when applying machine learning to choose trades and make money. Therefore, this class is one of the easiest to complete work ahead of time with only minor changes once the project requirements are finalized. The midterm and final are easy multiple choice exams.',

I did have  natural advantage in this course in that I have worked in the finance sector building trading systems for sell side brokers + I had taken AI as my first course (so my comments on ease of course may be a bit harsh)\nI took this course because\n(1) I wanted an easy summer after taking AI - which was brutal in comparison\n(2) I wanted to learn a bit about practical application of ML in the upstream systems that feed the trading systems I work on in my day job\nEven without a background like mine I would say the course is extremely easy.  As others have commented some of the exam questions were farcical for a graduate level course and a number of the assignments involved little more than mechanically coding formulae or spoon fed descriptions of solutions given in lectures.   That said the course did provide a rgood general overview of how  buy side hedge funds operate and the  two main assignments did provide a bit more challenge.\nIf you have limited financial or ML knowledge this course will provide you with a gentle and enjoyable introduction to both and it will supply you with good high level understanding of how financial markets operate.   However you are given  a very simplified view of the markets and it will not prepare you for dealing with any of complexities you would encounter with if you were trading in the real world.\nOverall  the course was fun and I did feel I learnt some useful things from the course (although a good bit less than I had hoped)\nI do feel that the difficultly was below that of a  graduate level course.and in my opinion the content and difficultly should be seriously increased.   More depth and challenging open ended projects would make this a very interesting and valuable course rather than an easy but enjoyable summer option that does not really live up to its potential',

Looking at you, AI.\nNo dealing with Bonnie.\n\nCONS:\n\nMultiple choice exams that are sometimes arbitrary. The final had at least 5 question about "The Big Short", some being "To what cities did characters travel?" - Seriously? This is a gradschool level course. There are only 30 questions too so watching this movie and remembering this stuff was imperative. It felt like they ran out of things to ask.\nThe final is based on the entire semester so you have to study the whole damn course beforehand.\nExam is closed book so prepare to memorize equations.\n',

It turned out to be a good decision. I would not call this class easy, as it needs fair amount of work in parameter tuning and developing reports / visualizations etc. But enjoyed building my own strategy to do some basic trading.\nHighlight of this class was the finance fundamentals combined with coding in Python. I did not have any prior finance background and this class taught me many valuable concepts. I could also get better at Python. Really liked the class overall. I'd recommend it for the first semester!\nP.S. One thing to add: for the last project, there were continuous changes to it till the last moment. That made us really confused regarding the details. There were updates regarding the number of charts allowed till the last 3-4 days before submission deadline. What added to frustration was there were a couple of changes even after the assignment was declared 'Finalized' and we had to redo the work a few times. I feel this caused unnecessary pressure and anxiety.",

            review: "So, I really wanted to like this course more. It was a good intro to ML, but don't expect to be able to do any real trading after. The techniques taught are fairly basic and you would be destroyed if you actually tried to use them outside of the carefully controlled toy environment.\nThe course was abbreviated over the summer (one of the projects was dropped, leaving 6). The lectures were pretty good, although both textbooks were totally unnecessary.\nI have two main complaints. The exams were trivial to the point of meaningless. There were questions on a movie that we were asked to watch (The Big Short) that you could have got the answers to by watching the trailer (they weren't financial questions either). The other questions were related to the material, but if you cram the relevant lectures in for a few hours before taking the exam, you're guaranteed to get a 90 or above (unless you just can't remember simple facts - little to no math required).\nSecondly, although this clearly wasn't the first time this course had been run throughout the summer, it may as well have been. Projects weren't finalized (or available on Canvas) until the last minute, and the final (hardest) project was still having fairly major tweaks right up until the weekend before it was due.\nLuckily, this didn't affect me because I'm lazy and had barely started it at that point, but others were not happy.\nIn short, this is an easy course if you keep your wits about you. You'll likely have more difficulty keeping up with the changing requirements than you will with the actual material. So yeah - a fairly realistic preparation for real work in that sense.\nOverall, I recommend it, but you may not get as much out of it as you would hope.\nAdditionally, some of the TAs were really unhelpful to the point of antagonism. I didn't personally run into this, luckily, but there were others that did.",

            review: "Took DVA and AI before this one, also had some background in finance (CFA charter holder). There're 3 min courses: python/pandas, finance, ml. For my background, most of the things are like refreshers, and only thing I learned from this course is how to use ML to make trading decisions, any maybe some different way to implement decision trees, random forrests and q-learning. Still interesting though, to see how ML and AI can help with trading securities. and this course's work load is perfect for a relaxing summer. Except the final project+repot took me 3 whole days, others (first 5 projects, 2 exams) are pretty light. There's also a homework to watch movie \"the big short\", which is interesting.\nI wish there's a follow up course that gets deeper into how ML can do with trading, but this course is a great introduction to people with minimum exposure to finance, hedge fund, python, pandas, and machine learning. Especially for the point that Dr. Balch would give very detailed guidance for home assignment/projects, which could be very helpful for learning, but maybe not that interesting for more experienced students.\nI would highly recommend as one of the first courses to get you started in OMSCS program.",

This course had a decent amount of material (both financial and technical).\nI think the projects could have been more in depth, and some of the projects could have been portions of others.  They did build on one another, which gave a flow and continuity, but I would like to have had more lectures on indicators, why some succeed vs fail, etc.\nProf. Balch was the most engaged and interactive professor that I've had at GATech.  He posted frequently on Piazza (whereas I had never seen that from a professor before, other than when complaining about students who are complaining), as did the TAs.\nThe biggest area for improvement is 'finalizing projects', which sometimes had changes coming in until the last day or two.  On the plus side, the legacy projects were available to start on, but one could not finish and submit until within 24-48 hours.",

            review: "Here's my piazza thank you note (also serves as a review)\nHello Everyone,\nI'd like to first thank the TAs and Prof.Tucker for this amazing summer trading adventure! This goes down as one of my favorite courses because of its high quality content on trading, and also because it helped us build 'applied' machine learning skills. I've taken ML courses at GT and CMU before, so I didn't come here to learn about ML as first-timer. I was planning on taking this course to do some applied machine learning and work with stuff like Pandas, numpy and I should say that I wasn't disappointed at all!\nThis course also served as a great introduction to trading. In fact, I've been inspired to trade using Robinhood on the side.  But that's a story for another day. Now, there were a few things that I disliked about the course and that doesn't have anything to do with the content:\n\n\nHow it was run - I thought it was a mess. Frankly, TAs and the Prof. were kind of absent from Piazza. This might not be entirely a bad thing. But at some point I hoped that they intervened and confirmed a few things - such as grading questions, deadlines, rubric. I would like to thank my peers on piazza who helped people debug stuff, write test cases, and also posted strategies on tackling assignments. Yay crowdsourcing!\n\n\nThe way assignments were released -  Why weren't they finalized until the last moment ( like  <5 days before the deadline) ? I do agree the most changes were really minor, but I'm highly uncomfortable doing old assignments with old information. This is a personal but I'd like to bring it up - I delayed doing all my assignments (yes even strategy learner!) until they were finalized, cause I couldn't mentally prepare myself working with old stuff that might change.\n\n\nWiki issues - Why even have a \"Summer 2018\" page if it isn't updated. Seriously,  why couldn't 1 TA spend half a day at the beginning of the semester and update all the wiki information?  Here's what I find on the wiki page, even now, when the course has completed:\n\n\n\"You are on the page for information specific to the summer 2018 session of this course. Go here (Machine_Learning_for_Trading_Course) for overall course policies.\nPlease note: This page is still in revision we will announce by email when it is finalized.\"\nI feel that these issues have degraded the quality of the course quite a bit. But overall, I'm satisfied because of the great content and teaching (thanks Prof. Tucker!)\nThanks everyone",

I wanted to love it.\nThe coding assignments were on the easy side, but I did learn a lot from them. And they were fun.\nTests were a breeze but please spend some time studying for them\nProfessor Balch is a solid gem. He was more engaged in the class than I have seen from any other course Instructor. He is good natured and a great lecturer. The Udacity lectures are put together well.\nA handful of the TAs did an outstanding job, which, as far as I can tell from having taken 6 classes is what can make or break a course. And, although the TAs may vary from semester to semester, they don't change each semester. I've noticed that more involved Professors in a class are more involved with the TAs which means the TAs have more ability to be definitive and helpful in general.\nI knew NOTHING about finance or the stock market before taking this class, but I came away with a comfy familiarity. I'm not going to run out and bet the farm, but I am not so in the dark anymore about trading and its jargon.\nNote: I took AI before this class and would recommend going at it the other way: Take ML4T before AI for a more gentle intro to some basic concepts that will help you with AI homework.",

            review: "This class is a mix of introductory regarding finance and machine learning. I liked ML part a lot, it is very good introduction for people who have no prior experience of ML. Personally I could not be so interested in finance part though. Assignments (projects) are all python programming assignments (and some reports) and they were simply fun. We need to watch a long lecture video which is not designated for Udacity format but the professor explains what to implement step by step. As long as you attend Piazza regularly and ask if you need some help, someone can assist you and you should be able to complete all assignments (while the last one is bit difficult I think). I've never checked eventually but people also used Slack and it sounded very active.\nMidterm exam was not so difficult, it has a lot of resource to prepare but the last exam was basically with no hint for questions in advance, so it's bit random and it also asks very non-essential questions like a location of some scene in the movie....\nI recommend try getting full marks in assignments and attend Piazza regularly then you can get A with even 70-80 exam scores. At least for this summer class, no curve and no extra credits. Also recommend reviewing Python before the class. Also, start a project as early as possible. I first expected that I can start work on assignments after they're finalized, but sometimes it was finalized just a several days before a deadline. The differences were minimal from last semester so you shouldn't be worried about it so much.\nGenerally the professor and TAs are very helpful and approachable.",

I'd strongly recommend taking this before 7641 (Machine Learning) as a concrete example of Machine Learning construction methods for several learners as well as an example of how to organize and think about specific data before applying ML techniques.\nI'll say Prof Balch was absolutely approachable, entertaining (in a dad-joke way :) ), and authentic in his presentation.\nThe nits I must pick are that the material is disorganized, the Piazza participation grade leads to chaos and overload, and the late-finalization of assignments is a little frustrating.  Grading was super-quick though.",

It is both a horizon-broadening opportunity and a good introduction to machine learning. Projects are not not difficult if you have experience in Python. I took it in the shorter summer semester, but I did not feel the workload is heavy at all. Lectures are well made. Assignments are well defined and have a template to start with. I especially like the last two assignments in which I got exposure to reinforcement learning.\nIn general, I like this course. It is not that time consuming, but I actually have learnt stuff.',

            review: "As my first real ML course, it was a decent introduction to ML concepts, though I wish it had gone more in-depth into actual trading strategies. The pacing of the course feels a little off at times. You'll cover almost all of the Udacity lectures prior to the midterm and will be watching YouTube videos of live classroom-recorded lectures afterwards, which tend to drag on due to technical problems and other in-class reasons.\nWhile all assignments are posted on the wiki up front, we were warned they they were all subject to change and that they would be finalized at least two weeks prior to their deadline. This never happened and each was finalized just a few days before being due. Most assignments remained relatively unchanged, but the \"very challenging\" final project was finalized 5 days before it was due, and then changed again after being finalized to add a new section worth 15% of the grade. Needless to say, the instructor communication in this course was very poor. The TAs were great and grades were returned fastest of any of the 6 OMSCS courses I've taken, but it was obvious they had extremely limited say in how things were run. Professor Balch was MIA for most of the course, leading to a lot of unnecessary confusion on Piazza. Combined with the new \"Piazza participation\" metric worth 5% of our grade, Piazza was difficult to meaningfully follow.\nThe projects were fairly easy overall. Some have YouTube videos with the professor walking you through a solution, while another took literally a few minutes to complete. There were 2 fewer projects in the Summer semester, though a portion of one was built into the final project. Two of the projects required writing reports, though neither was very intimidating due to the rubric spelling out exactly what to include.\nThere were 2 ProctorTrack exams of about equal, moderate-to-easy difficulty, though the final did include a few questions about The Big Short movie that were completely inappropriate/unrelated to this graduate-level course material.\nThere were 3 books (1 required, 2 optional), but I didn't use any of them and had no problem getting As on every assignment and exam.\nOverall, an easy class even for summer, made mildly frustrating only due to the professor's lack of engagement in making simple clarifications and some students' lack of Piazza etiquette (exacerbated by the participation portion of our grade).\nCourse material is publicly available at http://quantsoftware.gatech.edu/Machine_Learning_for_Trading_Course",

The course provides a great overview and introduction to machine learning concepts, reinforcement learning and finance without diving into the weeds. But if you already have a introductory machine learning background this course likely won't provide much value to you. This would be a good course to pair with another course since the time commitment is not as large per week as some other courses. However, communication between the professor and TAs regarding finalization of projects and content covered on exams was severely lacking. In many instances official communications did not finalize the projects until a few day before they were due. Project descriptions from previous semesters were made available to us at the beginning of the course and luckily in many cases the descriptions changed minimally once the project was finalized. There was a midterm exam and a final exam administered via ProctorTrack.",

If you\'ve been exposed to the ML concepts before, and/or have been introduced to NumPy/Pandas, then you won\'t find too much additional to learn. I had just taken AI so was fairly comfortable with the concepts and NumPy already. There really isn\'t enough here to fill a semester, even a compressed summer semester.\nClass uses lame "Piazza participation" metric, which counts for 5% of the grade and caused the forum to be mostly filled with "thanks" and "+1" messages. I didn\'t really need to visit Piazza for help during the semester but went there every day just to click through the messages and occasionally answer a question so I wouldn\'t get a zero on participation.  This policy also seems to benefit greatly the students who are asking the really embarrassing questions (e.g. "how do I install the python? I have no programming").\n\nOverall though, I can\'t complain too greatly. It was somewhat interesting and not too stressful. Made for a relaxing summer.',

If you are someone who likes to not wait until the night before to complete an assignment, this can be difficult. Many students get flustered by this.\n\n\nSome of the material is arguably superfluous in an elementary fashion (re-watching movies to answer exam Q's, etc)\n\n\nThe assignments are mostly rigid (scaffolded starter code, exact api specifications, etc) and don't allow for too much creativity, exploration, or struggle. This is the exact reason for the gap between academia and the real world. The projects need to be more open ended, involve dirtier data, etc; only then through a turbulent trial and error process involving practical roadblocks, will students truly learn ML4T techniques, and more importantly, learn how to solve problems with ML.\n\n\nNevertheless, the course is quite enjoyable but could use an overhaul of content and coordination procedure.",

In general there is a lot of hand-holding with the assignments.\nIt can be challenging and time consuming to put together the projects but you can start as early as the first day of the course. It's really up to you.\nMaterial is interesting and the professors seems to be genuinely enthusiastic about both, trading and machine learning. If you have had no previous exposure to machine learning, it could be a more or less painless intro to it.\nI will say, however, this is a huge class and piazza is a mess most of the times.",

            review: "Took this course to complete the ML specialization requirements. After having taken DVA, RL and ML, it was a shock to see how easy this course is. If you know little about ML and/or python, this is probably a good first class to take in the program, but if you do you are likely to be bored by the programming aspects.\nThe finance part was OK. I started out as a believer in the efficient market hypothesis (which basically says that you can't profit by doing ML for trading, and therefore that the material in this class should be essentially useless), and I like having been exposed to the perspective of a professor who obviously disagrees with it. I'm still not 100% convinced, but this was an interesting experience.\nOne thing that disappointed me was that the midterm was almost exactly the same as one of the sample midterms that was made available to us for reviewing. In other words, we were given the answers to the midterm beforehand... As someone who wants to be challenged, I find this very disappointing.",

            review: "Machine Learning for trading is an excellent course. It's a great starter course, as it isn't too difficult, but beware that the difficulty does ramp up towards the end of the course (though it still doesn't get exceptionally difficult) so don't let the first half fool you into thinking the second half is just as easy. Lecture material is very interesting, essentially being split into half-financial and half-intro to machine learning.\nThe projects all build upon one another in some way, so it's advisable to spend a sufficient amount of time making sure each one is done properly. You can work ahead, as all project descriptions and legacy code are available on the class website, BUT, the projects may change slightly closer to release so keep that in mind when you work ahead. DO NOT wait until projects are finalized before you start working on them, despite the chance some slight tweaks may be made to projects up to the week before it is due, start them as soon as you can. This is especially true with all of the projects starting from and including assess_learners.\nI would suggest making sure your marketsim project works perfectly when you get there. The most time consuming projects are assess_learners, manual_strategy and strategy_learner, with the latter two using your marketsim code, so make sure to allocate enough time to work on these when you get there. Also, for manual_strategy you will have to do some research into stock price indicators, and this project is used as a comparison for strategy_learner so it's good to choose these indicators wisely based on this research.\nThere are two proctored exams,  one mid-term and one non-cumulative final exam. Questions aren't difficult as long as you review all of the material, watch all of the required additional videos (e.g., The Big Short), and go over the practice questions/previous term exams where possible.\nAll-in-all, the material is interesting, the projects are overall well-structured and utilize the material conveyed in lecture, and often even have instructional videos to help guide you through some of the more involved projects.  TAs were responsive and easy to reach on PIazza, though Dr. Balch is often very helpful he can be a bit curt.",

If you're new to ML, Technical Analysis, or Python, this is an excellent first course. While the material effectively covers material sufficient for an introduction, you are free to take your learning further. For example, when learning about Reinforcement Learning, you can simply watch the course videos, or you can supplement your learning by reading the relevant sections from Suttons' book: Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction and the videos from the OMSCS Reinforcement Learning and Machine Learning courses. The approach you take, combined with the skills you begin with, will determine how much time you spend on the course.\nPROJECTS AND EXAMS\nThe projects build upon one another, so if you get something wrong it is critical that you go back and fix it. Also, beginning projects early is extremely useful, because some projects require experimentations and papers. I was surprised at how a few students would appear on Piazza or Slack a few days before the project was due proclaiming that they had not started the assignment and was asking how long it would take to complete. Again, the approach you take will determine how much you get from the class.\nENGAGEMENT\nI found the unofficial Slack community the most active - 24/7, especially in the days leading up to a project's due date or an exam. In many cases, students would answer questions in minutes or hours. Piazza was also useful, where some TAs were very active. Although, unlike Slack, answers from TAs or the professor ranged from minutes to days. I found my TA quite good and he would pull in other TAs when he couldn't provide a definitive answer. The professor was active on Piazza for the first half of the course, but was sparsely present during the second. Fortunately, the course proceeded smoothly with the head TA (who has previously taught the course) and other TAs actively participating.\nTIPS\n",

Unfortunately, this is a Finance class under the guise of a \"Machine Learning\" class. I put Machine Learning in quotes, because even Andrew Ng's outdated, free Coursera class provides a better introduction to ML compared to this one. By the way, there is zero mathematical background required for what is taught in this course, which is disappointing. If you compare the curriculum to Stanford/UC Berkeley/MIT, you will see that they are miles apart.\nWhat You'll Learn\nYou will implement: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Trees, Bagging/Boosting, and Q-learning. The rest of the course is about finance, with some Python syntax thrown into the mix. In addition, this course doesn't feel like a master's level class due to the amount of hand-holding it does (step by step instructions on what to do, you just need to convert it into Python syntax).\nPositives\nThe videos for this course are well-done, are interesting and are directly tied to the projects, unlike other classes. Also, because there's no curve, the classroom environment becomes very positive (not competitive) and people genuinely try to help everyone else.",

You aren't going to leave this class and be Warren Buffet, or know everything you need to know to make a high frequency trader, but you'll have a decent grasp, and give you enough of a teaser to let you know if you want explore ML or finance further.\nClass itself was pretty easy. Projects could be easy, or hard depending on you. I spent a lot of time messing around, but if I had focused I probably could have finished things a lot faster and easier.\nId recommend it to someone who wants a light introduction to machine learning.",

There are 8 assignments that u can even start working on from the first day (of course not recommended). The videos are excellent - short, to the point and very close to the subject matter and the assignment.\nAssignments\nAll the assignments are evenly spaced and equivalently weighted. I would recommend referring to all the information\nat http://quantsoftware.gatech.edu/Main_Page to learn more about this course itself.\nFew over achievers might grumble :), but the first part of the course (mini course for pandas) was extremely important for the final part of the assignments\nExams\nThe exams are intended to test if your understood the videos and the concepts and does not try to trick you out of your grades. For the midterm, there are crowd sourced question banks whose intentions are to make sure you actually understood the various parts of the course. If you have gone through them all and figured out the basics behind them, the midterm should be simple enough though it is closed book and proctored.\nThe final does not have a question bank, but the same methodology of going through your videos and material should make it simple enough.\nParting words\nThe last three assignments as noted as indeed challenging and equivalently given two weeks to complete. You can even start them on the first day though there might be tiny edits to the grading script at a later point.\nBut this is one of the best constructed courses and if you have some background in python, should be simple to pick up and any insights in finance would be an added booster.\n_Note: Though the course is constructed exceptionally well, it is not an easy A and you would still need to put in the hours required. Especially the two assignments marked as "Very challenging" easily took 20-25 hours over two weeks. _',

I had zero experience with both Pandas and Numpy and still only spent 5-7 hours every week. I also enjoyed the finance theory aspect. It made me appreciate the finance side of things more than I thought I would have.\nThe course itself will teach you not a lot new if you know even a bit about ML. The Q Learning RL project is interesting but is dealt with at a basic high level. I wish we spent more time on reinforcement learning.\nThe trading part is basic for an ML course focused entirely on trading. Yes we build some technical indicators to trade on but don't expect to learn anything cutting edge for finance. No Deep Learning. No discussion on high speed algo trading strategies. I wish we were trading in a simulator in real time for our final project or at least had a Kaggle final project. That would have been cool.\nThis is a good course if you're looking to get your feet wet in ML/Python but if you already took AI, RL and ML then it can be redundant. I recommend taking this course early on in your OMSCS career before you venture out to the other ML classes as it will be good prep for some of the harder courses.",

There is a lot of info about this course publicly available at http://quantsoftware.gatech.edu/.\nThere are 8 projects in the class, and for the most part they increase in difficulty as you go along.  The first two were almost nothing; they can barely be classified as projects.  But it makes sense because they're supposed to serve as introductions.  All of the projects were very interesting and fun to do.  I have no previous ML experience (except for some basic boosting/bagging from CV but that was hardly a decent exposure, as much as I enjoyed CV) and that didn't hurt me in this class at all.  It was so cool in the final project to program a trading system based on machine learning and look at the results.  Code is tested on real stock data from real companies with some made up companies thrown in every now and then.\nAll of the project info is available ahead of time (see the link above) with the caveat that everything is in \"draft mode\" at first and will be \"finalized\" later.  For some reason this was a huge problem for some people in the course.  They refused to start until the project was finalized, which is kind of stupid on their part.  We were told repeatedly not to do that and that any changes made would be minimal.  The biggest change that I remember is in the second project.  We had to optimize something different from the previous semester's students.  Aside from that I think one or two other projects had a minor change and all the others had literally no change.  People blew this draft mode thing way, way out of proportion.\nThere is a proctored midterm and a proctored final.  Both are closed everything.  The final is not cumulative.  The midterm was extremely easy and was almost a regurgitation of previous midterms.  It sounded like that won't always be the case.\n3 textbooks.  One is required and is co-written by the professor.  It's fairly cheap (especially for a textbook) and is a pretty good read.  You'll definitely want it for the midterm at least.  The other two books are Python for Finance by Hilpisch and the ML book by Mitchell.  I can't remember if those two were actually required, but I didn't find them completely necessary.  The lectures were enough.\nIt's often said that a finance background is helpful for this course.  I think what people mean is a trading background, not a finance one.  I have almost no finance background but I do have a relatively extensive trading background, and that helped a lot.  I think manual_strategy would be the most difficult for people with no trading background since it requires an understanding of technical analysis and indicators.  This stuff isn't too difficult, but it is a lot to learn on top of everything else if you're new to it.\nThat's kind of true of the course in general.  It's not that this material is difficult, it's just that there is sometimes a lot of work in a short timespan.  If you have a good background in Python or trading then it'll be less work, of course.\nThis is a good first class if you can get in your first semester.  Also, this course potentially pairs well with other courses, depending.  I paired it with IIS and had no problems.  If you have no Python background and no trading background then I don't recommend taking it over the summer.  But, I do recommend this course in general overall.",

It presents some machine learning concepts, like decision trees, gradient descent, and reinforcement learning, in a context with direct application.

You'll spin your wheels a while if you've never used these libraries.  Some assignments can't be completed without leveraging the numpy and pandas matrix operations effectively (for loops cause the grader to time out) and there are some assignments that require reports with charts and graphs built with pyplot.  All the financial and market information you need for the course is presented at the beginning and I never wished I had studied that before hand.\nI should mention that the course starts off a bit disorganized but that improves.  Expect the first week or so to be on your own.  Also, the assignment instruction are often in a \"draft\" state until less than a week before they're due but none of them had significant changes when they were finalized.

Later you learn Q learners and dyna and use that to the trading problem for the last assignment. Although you get a choice to use some earlier algorithms learned in the class, most end up using Q learner to solve it. It is advisable to learn some Pandas and numpy as they are used extensively throughout the assignments. I had a tough time using pandas for plotting graphs but managed it well in the end. Learning how array slicing works will help a lot. Also learning how to vectorize will shave some secs off your run time and you get bragging rights in slack and piazza for this. Make sure you are active on slack and piazza as tons of great advise are given by some great minds in the class. If not for slack, I would have struggled to understand and approach the problems on my own. And finally, the TAs in this class are a complete joke. You are assigned a specific TA and the one I had did not show up for the Office hour. Barring a few TAs, most don't help much and just ridicule you on Piazza if you ask something obvious. Having said that, I liked prof Balch's humor and approach. He supplemented the udacity videos with some youtube videos and that helped greatly for solving the assignments. Overall a great class.

I've actually had conversations with coworkers about day trading thanks to what I learned in this course. It is practical!\nI found the projects to be enjoyable throughout the semester. They do a good job of building upon each other as the semester progresses, and they're balanced appropriately. The two most difficult (time consuming) projects were spread throughout the semester. The midterm was fair and shouldn't be too challenging to anyone that stays on top of the course content throughout the semester.\nMajor pro: all assignments for the semester were released in draft at the start of the course. This allowed you to work ahead if you knew you had scheduling challenges coming up during the semester.\nBiggest con: Although the projects built upon one another, we often had to copy and paste code from one file into another. I would have liked the different files/classes to interact with one another a little better. That being said, though, that's a pretty minor con.\nThe coursework was never insanely difficult, but it did a great job providing an intro to some ML and RL concepts.

            review: "This is my third course at OMSCS. ML4T is a fun course and well run.  Professor Balch is enthusiastic about the material and is highly engaged in running the course day to day, which I think is really important for an online program. I've enjoyed the projects a lot - they give a nice intro into the various ML concepts as well as pandas and numpy. This class isn't the hardest I've taken, but it's not the easiest either. It feels like a pretty good balance, and an excellent first class to take. The projects are not a wash and require a good time investment.\nIt's been my largest class with 500? people I think, which leads to the one drawback - it's difficult to stay on top of the Piazza threads and participate meaningfully. They just explode very quickly around project deadlines and before exams.  I  know it's something Professor Balch has been experimenting with, such as using reddit last term.\nOverall I highly recommend this course.",

            review: 'This was my first class in the program and I enjoyed it. I\'d recommend it as a first class for anyone.\nMost assignments took me around 3-5 hours. There were two larger assignments with writing components which took me around 20 hours each.\nThe class was well run overall although the assignments were usually not finalized until a week (sometimes less) before they were due. This is not a course that can be "front-loaded."\nA 90% is required to get an A, but since the assignments are mostly auto-graded and the assignments have clear grading requirements (like 10% for graphs, 20% for code, etc) 90% is very achievable.',

            review: 'Great courses for anyone who is interested in both ML and Trading in stock market. The course was divided to 3 parts (intro to pandas, intro to financial market, ML for trading). This structure was excellent and really well-thought. Anyone with zero experience can get through this course smoothly (well you need common sense as well).\nLectures are okay and well prepared. There are some recorded on-campus lectures that explained the assignment in details. The assignment was easy since you can test your code in the remote machine so if you ace it, it means full score. Exam and mid-term were okay, you can review 1-2 days before taking it. The reddit experiment was not working and I hope they stick to piazza in the future.',

The third assignment onwards got pretty hard.\nPROS:\n\nExcellent test cases. Even the py.test files were given so you could see the expected answers for the test cases. Prof encouraged students to share test cases as well.\nProfessor was very active on reddit. Seems like 50% of all posts were from the prof.\nAssignment expectations and deliverables were clear.\nCourse was well planned and executed.\nCONS:\nProfessor's posts were a little rough around the edges. If you have thick skin, then it won't be an issue.\nProf's bully behavior encouraged bad behavior from students as well. Some simple questions asked by students got responses like \"you don't belong here at GT\", etc.\nSeems like prof was paranoid about class material leaking to future students. No suggested homework solutions were given. TA's were there to help clarify assignment details, but did not offer real help on homework. There were mistakes in notes, but were corrected in the video lectures (I think this was done to make notes useless to unauthorized people who get hold of the notes; just speculating).\n",

            review: "The focus on this class seems to be more towards the trading side of things. If you want a deep dive into ML topics, this isn't such a class. There is use of ML techniques like Reinforcement Learning, but know that the main subject is trading in on itself. Fall 2017 was the first time Reddit was used instead of Piazza and I felt like this experiment didn't work out that well. For an academic class, Reddit just doesn't have enough tools to deal with all the announcements and tags needed. Professor Balch was great and very hands on though! He was quick to reply in all posts and questions and so were the TAs. The lecture structure has changed a little (no longer follows the order on Udacity) but otherwise they were straight to the point. The add on lectures on Youtube helped supplement the material and projects well. The projects don't take too much time to complete and sometimes all it takes is an \"ah hah!\" moment to figure out what you need to do. Great class to pick up as a first class.",

            review: "Going into this class, I had taken AI and knew a fair amount about stock trading.  This class gave an introduction to Machine Learning topics as well as stocking market concepts and in a final project, allowed you to create a market trading strategy that was powered by one of several algorithms you learned in class.  The course used Python and was light in a coding from my perspective as a software developer.  If you were not a coder, getting up to speed with Python and Numpy will take a fair amount of time.  Thankfully, as is becoming a trend in OMSCS courses, most of the assignments have grading scripts so you know the majority of your grade by the time you submit your assignment.  There is the caveat that reports require manual effort to be graded and occasionally, there are additional test cases the TAs use that are not included with the grading scripts but still fit within the specifications of the project.\nOverall, this was a very enjoyable class that was fairly graded.  There were two exams that were worth 12.5% of your grade each that were 30 questions in 30 minutes.  As you'd expect with that format, you must be a quick reader and thinker but ultimately know the concepts very well to do well on the exam.  For those that overanalyze or how to think through each exam questions, you will struggle on this kind of an exam and while the exams are not worth a large portion of your grade, you do need to perform decently to get an A in the class.\nAs with most classes you enjoy, the Professor makes the class what it is as the instructor lectures on Udacity are extremely engaging and entertaining while also being brief and informative.",

            review: "8 projects (67% total) and 2 Exams (12.5%/each) account for the majority of your final grads, the rest points are almost giving it for free.\nFor each assignment, you can check the project details here (http://quantsoftware.gatech.edu/CS7646_Fall_2017#Assignments). Do notice that each project is tagged as Easy, Moderate, Challenging, and Very Challenging. That's based on Professor's own experience, and MAY NOT suit your case. For me, the hardest project is manual_strategy, which was labeled as merely Moderate, while the Very Challenging one feels like a breeze. So, don't assume the time it requires for each project has a direct correlation with the difficulty labels. You may put yourself in an awkward situation.\nAnd regarding the exams, you'll need to answer 30 multi-choices within 35 minutes. You might argue about the limited time given, but trust me, it's perfectly sufficient to finish the test. I completed the Midterm & Final within 20 mins, and I still got 10 mins to go through each question before submitted it. No hard calculation, just concepts/ideas and shrubberies. If you could not answer it within seconds, I highly doubt that you could get the right answer out with more time given.\nOverall, if you 1) are interested in learning financial strategies, or 2) want to apply the ML approach you acquired to investing, or 3) need a intro-class before taking Machine Learning, I highly recommend this course.",

Udacity Video lectures are effective and entertaining, the YouTube videos have important material but are generally too long and not as well structured.

            review: "This class is definitely a basic introduction to machine learning, with more of the class focused on using NumPy and Pandas and a few financial markets topics.  In terms of difficulty, most of the projects are very straightforward, and Professor Balch provided additional videos that walked through pseudo code or algorithm outlines.  Two of the projects are more challenging, but still reasonable.  I would have preferred that some of the early easy projects be combined to allow for an additional machine learning project at the end.  The huge class size (~700 in the online portion) exposed that there are limits to how high a class can be scaled before execution problems emerge.  This class pairs well with other classes, as long as attention is paid to the higher workload in the last few weeks of the class.\nPROS:\n--Lectures were clear.\n--Professor Balch was active on Reddit nearly everyday.\n--The material was interesting and a good example of how machine learning is applied in a single industry.\n--There seems to be some measure of updates and improvements each semester, so there is an effort to refine the course over time.\nCONS:\n--The amount of lecture material is light, particularly in the second half of the course.\n--Management of the course was often sloppy.  For example, the course started a few days late, project requirements sometimes weren't \"finalized\" until a few days before the due date, important clarifications of project expectations were sometimes contained in a single post buried in the Reddit megathreads that were hundreds of posts deep, messages to the class were infrequent or incomplete, it was often impossible to submit a project to T-Square until two days before the due date, wording of exam questions was often vague, and the checks for course participation were essentially abandoned halfway through the course.\n--There was very little feedback on projects.\n--The grading was slow for some of the auto-graded projects and participation quizzes.\n--It was a challenge to search the Reddit megathreads that were often several hundred comments deep.\n--Professor Balch's tone on Reddit sometimes didn't come across as very encouraging.\n--Some of the additional assigned shows or movies (e.g. The Big Short) weren't at all relevant to machine learning.\n--The answer key used to score the final exam had two incorrect answers (Professor Balch eventually acknowledged one mistake, but stood behind the other even though it directly contradicted an assigned video).\n--Professor Balch's frequent references to Monty Python are distracting and could be confusing to those that aren't native English speakers.",

            review: "I came into this class with little or no background in Python, Machine Learning, or finance. There was certainly a learning curve in all three areas but the course did a good job of introducing the material so that even a newbie like me could catch on. The lectures on Udacity are well done. The assignments are solid and teach you a lot (be careful, often they build on each other so you can't just skip one and think you'll be fine).\nI had two issues with the course - 1) assignments weren't finalized until a week (sometimes less) before the due date. The professor would say \"you can use the old version to get started, not much will change\" but both times I did that I had a few hours of rework once the final version was released. I am not sure why a course that's as mature as ML4T can't get assignments finalized sooner, my three previous classes released everything well before the due dates. 2) Reddit was not a good forum for the course. My guess is that anonymity was a factor, some students were downright rude to one another. Other students asked really simple questions that were answered clearly in the assignment or syllabus. I wonder if having your real name tied to the post would have reduced some of that. Also, the threads got too long. I had two questions that never got answered (slack was helpful when that happened). Other times replies would go on the wrong thread and it was confusing to read. I have nothing against reddit, but it didn't seem a good fit for this course.\nAs for workload, some weeks I put in only a few hours, other weeks were more like 20 hours when a project was due. I was learning Python while doing the projects, so that may be higher than normal. Agreed with other comments that the midterm was tough to finish (I finished with maybe a minute left, and I'm normally a great test-taker). I finished the final with plenty of time, but several questions were ridiculously unconnected to course content.\nFinally, the tone of the class was a bit off to me. Some of the professor's responses on reddit were rude. I've taken other classes in the program where I felt like the TAs and professor really cared about the students and their learning. In this class I didn't get that vibe at all.",

There is no curve, and the mid-term and final exams are like sprints, you barely have time to complete them, and a lot of students actually weren\'t able to complete the mid-term. The extra credit assignment is a joke, it requires more effort to complete than multiple projects combined, and it only contributes to 2% of your total grade. These horrible features of this course make it extremely nerve-racking, because you can easily lose a letter grade in the blink of an eye. It almost seems at times as if the professor dislikes seeing students do good in this course, and he tries really hard to prevent you from earning an A; I was able to earn one in the end, but it wasn\'t an "easy A" at all. I personally avoided asking questions via Reddit, because of the snarky replies the professor would issue to students. The course serves as a good introduction to Machine Learning, and you get to apply Machine Learning to stock trading in the last project, which was awesome.  Something else which you need to consider is the fact that projects build on each other, therefore if you fail to complete a project, or you implement it incorrectly, you will be toast.',

Exams were a joke: trick questions, rote memorization of terms/formulas, questions about python/pandas output - even questions about plot points of a vaguely-topical movie.

I've compared it with students who took it on-campus a couple years ago and there's a staggering difference.\n2 closed book exams, rather than 1 open-note midterm.\nOptional \"difficult\" extra credit assignments have become full fledged assignments.\nThe class is great overall. My favorite aspect was the implementation of learning algorithms. I took RL and ML beforehand, but they were more theory based or had you use libraries. I felt like this refined some of my ML knowledge. I didn't know much about finance or the stock market coming in, so I appreciated taking that away from the class as well.\nGetting a good grade is another story. There is no curve, and I could see it being easy to mess up one assignment and totally kill any hope of you getting an A or B. Thus in order to succeed, you have to come at it in full-force. Don't underestimate some of the assignments. Start early or learn regret the hard way.\nThe workload is medium. Probably just the right amount of class-work for someone employed full-time. Sometimes I would have to devote all of Saturday or my entire weekend to the class.\nThe professor has nice lectures, but the reddit format was painful despite being a \"redditor\". Join a discussion late, and your comments will go buried. I agree with the other poster who mentioned that the class isn't the most flexible around the online student's time. You have to make sacrifices to accommodate the class's flimsical finalization of assignments, with short deadlines.\nIf I were to go back in time, I'd still take the class again.",

The class starts out simple with minimal time requirements but will quickly ramp up about 3 projects in. The ML section in the second half is extremely interesting, but you'll be bored to death with the first half/midterm if you don't care for finance.\nThe projects are extremely interesting and well thought out, but Tucker often takes almost a week to finalize a project. Don't wait to start on projects as a few of them are very time intensive. Overall a great introduction to supervised and reinforcement learning and would highly recommend.",

            review: "Overall the course content is great, but how the course is run leaves something to be desired. Be aware when the schedule is released that it may look like you have 2+ weeks for some assignments, but the professor will take so long in updating and finalizing the assignment that realistically you will have 1 week or less to finish it. And of course they won't let you know when to expect the assignment to be finalized either.\nThe projects can be quite interesting, and so far they're decently (but not overly) challenging. Previous reviews mention the course \"ramping up\" the difficulty over the semester, but they've redone the schedule of projects so be aware that some of the more challenging projects (assess learners I'm looking at you) are now earlier in the semester.\nI would definitely still recommend this class as the interesting projects/materials make up for the communication/expectation issues and the professors snarky responses on reddit.",

Tucker Balch is a great instructor and the TA's (Andrew Cassidy expecially) were excellent. The market fundamentals were nice to get to understand, and the lessons provided good information on them.\nAreas of the projects that would have posed most difficult (creating a decision tree algorithm ourselves) were covered very thoroughly in supplemental lectures. This took the overwhelming majority of guesswork out of the course, and instead tested the ability to implement, which I consider a good move.\nThe final project actually didn't grade on actual stock algorithm performance, which would have been extremely difficult (everyone is trying to beat the market, and thus very few can). Identifying unique stock signals is an important part of trading, and I didn't have the time (nor millions of dollars) to conduct satellite surveillance of AAPL's parking lot to gauge what the share price should be (this is actually done in real life). I think a good balance was struck on the final project regarding this.",

ML4T taught me from-scratch numpy, a handful of ML concepts/strategies, and a small taste of how equities managers from RenTech to Berkshire view their markets and trading opportunities. The numpy skills would have made it worthwhile alone, but you learn so much more if you give it the time it demands.\nTucker encourages a lively Piazza, and supplements the official lectures with plenty of extra videos.\nI found the exams challenging but fair. Read the official study guides and previous exams. Ignore the student generated stuff. That worked for me.\nThe course left me with an appetite for more ML, so that's what I'll take next.

I was getting an A on all the projects but I couldn\'t do well on the midterm which was relatively a large part of the overall grade. The exam was filled with finance/stocks junk, unrelated with ML somewhat, making the class very annoying for me personally. I ended up dropping out of the class, only because i didn\'t want to waste time reading about stocks and finance, and wanted to focus more on ML concepts in general. The technical material was easy to follow, and not overly complicated, It could have been an easy A for me, if it was just ML. It would be nice, if they redesign this course, remove the finance/stock material, and rename it to "Intro to ML".',

My undergrad included an AI specialization so I already had a decent understanding and moderate experience with machine learning. This class provided a good introduction to machine learning while still making the projects challenging enough for someone in my position to appreciate.\nMy biggest complaint with this class has to do with the fact that I took it over the summer. I would highly recommend that you take this class during a full-length semester if possible. I wanted to spend more time appreciating the concepts I was learning/implementing... but because of the fast pace of the summer, was unable to do so. I also didn't really appreciate that the instructors decided to add an extra exam this semester for the first time. It made the summer even more stressful than it already was.\nThe class is divided into 3 parts: 1) ML, 2) the stock market, 3) combining ML and the stock market. There are several projects (all coding, some include reports), two exams (finally is not cumulative), lots of lectures (with quizzes), and a participation grade that usually came in the form of a survey sent to your email.\nYou'll need extensive knowledge of Python for this class.",

            review: "This is definitely not an easy class (my overall grade for the class was >95%), especially for a person like me, who don't know much about either ML or trading. The exams were straightforward. The projects were of high quality and enforced students' learning: a basic market simulator, a random-tree learner (and how to beat this type of learners), Q-Learning robot maze navigation, and a learning trading agent. That last project (a learning trading agent) brought together virtually everything we learnt in that class into a single project! It was super fun, but was hard and time consuming.\nIn terms of time commitments, there were many quiet periods where nothing was due. But, I spent most of that time time reading suggested materials as much as I could. For instance, I read Prof. Balch book from cover to cover, skimmed Tom Mitchell's \"Machine Learning\" book, etc. And so, you may end up with less than 15 hrs/week on this class.\nOverall, I came out with a well-rounded understanding of what's going on in both ML and trading. Kudos to Prof. Balch for this solid class and his amazing organization. He was very funny and had a dry sense of humor. I would imagine taking his class in person might have been a very fun experience. Also, according to my fiancee, he had cute chuckles, which made her laugh.",

I had a basic to medium understanding of finance topics. I ended with an A in this class.\nThe problem? Professor Balch is kind of an egotistical dick; it comes out in almost every one of his piazza posts. The midterm was 30 minutes long with 30 questions and about a third of the questions were detailed "what happens in this pandas/numpy code?" without access to internet or the python interpreter.\nThe other problem? The final project is worth 17% of the grade but you\'re only given two weeks to work on it (maybe fall/spring will be longer) and the final exam is plopped right in the middle.\nSupposedly the final project was split into two projects previously and they had MUCH more time combined to work on it. I still managed 100/100 on it, but it added a few points to my blood pressure.\nOverall? I\'d still take the class. Just be cautious and heed the rubrics. You can get an A even if you stumble on the exams.',

The advantages are that the subject matter is pretty interesting, and you get to practice python in a pretty easy environment.\nHowever, like all OMSCS courses there is little to no feedback on your work. I'd love to see how to properly code some of the solutions to the projects, but I'll never see how to do it because the course organizers are too concerned with plagiarism in future classes. So I'm left at the end of the semester with an 'A' grade and a whole bunch of shitty code that works only half the time. I took off a few extra stars for the disorganization of the projects. Again, this seems to be the hallmark of a Georgia Tech course, where requirements constantly change right up to the deadline. Even when the requirements are finalized, we often couldn't submit until just before the deadline.\nPerhaps worst of all was the culture of Piazza during the term. Maybe we were just unlucky to have a high proportion of meanies in the class, but towards the end of term the forum mostly became a place to belittle other students, which culminated in a big, ugly, piazza fight. This kind of behavior was not discouraged by the TAs or the professor.",

The first 2 weeks walks you through some useful features of python, numpy, and pandas. The pacing is excellent and not "drinking from a firehose". After taking one of those famed "Baptism of Fire" courses in OMSCS as my first course, this course was very nice in helping me gain back some confidence.\nFun Factor: Very High. The applicability of finance and trading (which I also have some personal interest in) made the ML concepts stick just that much better.\nI put down 10 hours / week, but it\'s really more like 4-5 hours a week - potentially even less if you already have extensive python experience. Much of the time was spent fooling around with the people on slack (whose experience and camaraderie, I was told, was probably never to be repeated in the history of OMSCS slack channels). There were extracurricular contests going on to optimize code, etc. that sucked tens of hours each week.\nProfessor Balch and a number of the TAs were ever present on Piazza which was very helpful.\nLike most other OMSCS classes, the #1 killer is procrastination. Many folks were apparently caught blindsided by some schedule "squeezes" that were not anticipated. Also, some folks were seemingly blindsided by not carefully reading the assignments. Every assignment has a grading rubric that serves as the specs for the assignment. Read those 3 times, then 3 times again before turning in the finished assignment.',

Some things are kind of silly - you can basically just memorize the answers to most of the midterm and final exam by answering sample questions over and over. I believe it's easy to get an A if you watch all the videos since many hints are given on how to complete the assignments.",

Interesting introduction to finance... for whatever that's worth! Lectures can be watched at 2x, but are pretty dull. Exams are super easy. Coding assignments have skeleton code and take maybe 6 hours including tweaking (see http://quantsoftware. gatech. edu/ for syllabus and projects). Two reports are a bit more time consuming, but not difficult.",

            review: "This was my sixth course in the program. I came at this course after ML and RL, and have had previous experience in the securities industry, so I found this course pretty easy, but not without its challenges.\nThe good: The material is really interesting, and Prof. Balch is incredibly enthusiastic about the topic. You get an opportunity to implement some ML algorithms from scratch, and you learn a lot about the markets. Personally, this course is where I learned how powerful and useful Pandas and NumPy are.\nThe bad: Really, only one thing -- the assignments are subject to change as late as a week before they are due. Usually the changes only require a few minutes of work to implement, but it is frustrating if you are the type of student who likes to move things from to-do to done as soon as possible.\nI believe this course would make a good first course in the program. It's a gentler introduction to machine learning than 7641, and teaches some skills that will prove useful throughout the program. The finance knowledge is also fascinating.",

            review: "ML4T is my first course of OMSCS. It is overall a great introductive course to machine learning and stocks. ML4T consists of three mini-courses: (1)numpy and pandas, (2)hedge fund and stocks, and (3)basic ML methods (regression, kNN, decision tree, ensemble models) and reinforcement learning (Q-learning).\nStudents may find certain sections easy or hard. For me, because I have already some experience on Python and ML but have no finance background at all, the second part is difficult for me. But as long as you watch the videos and do some reading, there is no problem. If you have no background in finance or ML at all, ML4T is a good choice for an introduction.\nThus, I would recommend taking ML4T before ML7641 because ML4T doesn't require a deep understanding of ML or math. It can help you get familiar with numpy and pandas, have a big picture about ML and RL, and understand its applications in stocks. If you want to go further, you can learn more in ML7641 and RL7642.\nThe course is overall well scheduled. I can prepare things ahead and avoid big conflicts with my full-time job. But if you want to start an assignment very early (2 weeks ahead), be aware that the instructor will change the rubric a week (sometimes 3 or 4 days) before the deadline of the assignment. These changes would not ruin the framework or design of your codes. But you need to use your codes on different data and generate different results or graphs according to the new rubric. I think he did this to avoid plagiarism from previous assignments.\nThe grading of assignments is exactly based on the rubric. The rubric is overall clear to me. But you do need to spend some time to understand the rubric correctly. For me, Piazza is a great resource. The instructor, TAs and students are very responsive on Piazza. Yes, there are a LOT of posts on Piazza, and a lot of duplicate posts. But it doesn't bother me. It \"reinforces\" me to learn better by looking at other folks' questions.",

            review: "A very enjoyable class end-to-end, with a mix of topics that keep it interesting. There are still three main sections: Pandas & Numpy, Trading/Finance, and ML. But the professor has continued to adjust the weightings to bring in the ML earlier and speed through the Pandas faster.\nThe projects are interesting, with only one getting tedious (because of a lot of picky details about charts and formats). Don't worry about some late criticism you may read here about \"unclear\" requirements -- while not perfect, they were plenty clear for anyone who was paying attention -- that is to say, most of the class. [Hint: if it's a Classifier, it has to pick categories, not averages. ]\nWhy not a perfect 5? Well, as mentioned the materials have been evolving to put more emphasis on the ML section. But what starts as well-produced, clear instructional videos gives way to a lot of fuzzy, hard-to-read slow-paced recorded in-classroom lectures with the occasional low-budget office hours to give important assignment instructions. It all works, but it's a bit duct-taped together.\nOverall a continually fun and interesting class with phenomenal instructor involvement.",

There was a somewhat subtle item in the most heavily weighted assignment (which was a paper and could not be auto-graded to test this). It was never explicitly stated what you should do about it, but if you did not implement it exactly the way the instructor had in mind you lost 30% of your grade on the assignment (4. 5% of your overall class grade). The requirement was never placed into the documentation, but it was apparently explicitly told to the TAs like some sort of "test" that the students be able to intuit exactly what the instructor was thinking.\nOverall, the class was great, but it left a very sour taste in my mouth at the end for Professor Balch.',

Expect random unpinned forum comments to change or be the sole source of information about major project expectations. If you miss a couple of minor nuances in the projects because they are not officially mentioned anywhere and you didn't read every single one of the ~thousand Piazza posts, you could lose a full letter grade or two, even if you know the material through and through. I enjoyed the first half of this course, but the second half has me considering quitting OMSCS. I'm still new to the program, so my review may be slightly influenced by my disappointment in the way classes are managed in this program, but I am majorly disappointed that this class is one of the highest reviewed courses in the program. I definitely had a much more professional and all around better experience getting on campus degrees where I felt that my grades actually reflected my subject knowledge.\nI certainly learned a lot from the class material, so I don't feel like my time was wasted entirely, but everything else has been disappointing.",

            review: "This class was phenomenal. I haven't taken any ML courses before, and this seemed to serve as a good intro. The course is divided into three modules - basically numpy applications to finance, intro to finance, and machine learning (with a focus on finance).\nThe ML projects were the most work. It sounds like based on feedback, one of those projects was moved mid-semester rather than the end with the rest to attempt to distribute the workload a bit more evenly over the semester, which I thought was effective. Even with that modification, it was still the case that the workload was substantially more in the last month, so I'd advise future students to knock out all the lecture material in the first half of the semester. Conveniently, draft versions of all projects are available from the start of the semester, so I was able to work way ahead and not feel overwhelmed when April rolled around. Typically around a week before the due date there are some final modifications to the project requirements, which although annoying tended to be fairly minimal. I believe the intent was to make enough changes to prevent plagiarism from previous iterations of the course. Only once were these changes extremely substantial and disruptive (for the biggest project, no less), but all things considered I think this course was very organized and made it possible to start projects much sooner as compared to other courses I've taken.\nThe second to last project was a huge amount of work for me, but the rest were a manageable level of intensity. The projects largely build on each other (most projects reused code from previous ones), so it's essential to stay on top of them.\nThe instructors and TAs were generally friendly and very active on Piazza. There was around a week near a critical deadline where they vanished which proved to be quite frustrating for many, but in the end I think being very active 15 out of 16 weeks vastly surpasses the quality of interaction I've found in other classes.",

While it was neat to learn some Pandas and see the application of ML to the stock market, much of the ML application didn’t come until the latter third of the class. I’ve taken 9 classes in this program, and this one was the most disorganized that I’ve ever taken. Assignments were typically changed within a week of the deadline, submission windows were not open in a timely manner (in a couple of cases, only two days before the deadline), and Piazza was so noisy it became difficult to differentiate posts of actual substance (which may be credited to having 500 students in the class). Assignments often took many weeks to grade, and made it difficult at the end of the class to gauge if I needed to attempt the extra credit project since 36% of my grade was unknown. It was nice to have a utility that could run automated tests, but it ultimately had no effect on the project grade. This class could benefit from a tool like Udacity’s Bonnie to grade student assignments and return grades in a timely matter. Dr. Balch and the TAs were somewhat responsive on Piazza, but they disappeared towards the end of the semester. Overall, this is a class that should be taken prior to ML as a sort of introduction, due to its low workload and introductory material.',

All of the harder parts in the second half are quite interesting whereas the beginning starts out a little slow and annoying with a lot of Python API introduction that could be done more efficiently (i. e. learn NumPy and Pandas API's on your own).\nThe class is worth taking for its own interest and also as an easy intro to Machine Learning.\nBe warned that the time requirements and any half-finished reports saying it is easy are very misleading.\nIt starts out super easy and lulls you into a false sense of ease which will be shattered one or two days after it is too late to drop the class. After the drop date you will suddenly find the time requirements go up by about a factor of 5. The hours per week workload in the beginning it is maybe 5 hours or even less but after the drop date it can easily jump to 20 hours per week or more if you are not a \"pythonista\" or try for bonus points.\nProfessor Balch is super engaged on Piazza which is awesome! One or two of the TA's are also fairly engaged but the rest generally don't help out on Piazza.\nMake sure you watch the schedule carefully. Make sure you pay careful attention to assignment requirements and always test on the GA Tech buffet machines or provided VM, especially for execution time restrictions. If you work hard, put in the required time, and ask lots of questions then the assignments aren't too hard and can be aced. However, messing up one assignment, especially from something silly like using a disallowed library or not making sure it works in the grading environment can cost you a lot, possibly even a letter grade for a big assignment.\nOne problem with the class when I took it was that the assignments were not finalized in advance, and sometimes not even until a couple days before the due date. Not only does this interfere with working ahead but having the requirements get changed after you already submitted is rather annoying.",

I'd expect something like this from University of Phoenix, not Georgia Tech. The first 2/3 of the course require minimal effort if you're familiar with NumPy, as Pandas is pretty easy to pick up. The first 1/3 of the course is \"Hurray! Pandas is awesome!\" and taught in video by a TA. This videos are super short, and if you want to actually learn something about ML, read Mitchell's machine learning book and the papers it references.\nBooks:\nPython for Finance: skip. Everything in this book is online.\nMitchell's Machine Learning: If you want to actually learn the machine learning parts\nWhat Hedge Funds Really Do: Oversimplified, but an ok introduction. Used in the midterm, but way overpriced.\nThe assignment specs don't get posted in full until late, with many sharp edges on them regarding requirements. Most of the time you need to use Piazza and office hours to figure out what they actually want you to make. Assignments must be submitted with everything crammed into one or two *. py files. They also expect you to copy-paste code from your old assignment file into the next source file they expect you to make. Cool idea to build a module, bad implementation.\nTwo of our homework assignments were to write questions for the midterm, and we were graded (originally) on the acceptability of the questions. Seriously?\nTake it if you're in ML and need it, but overwise this class is too simplified to be useful in the real world.",

If you have taken ML in this program, you will find the ML section comparatively very light and you should pretty much know everything, but I do feel I gained something from having to implement some of the algorithms myself.\nIf you had asked me half-way through the semester, I would have said this is probably the easiest class I have ever taken. But, the last third of the class covers the ML topics and the workload ramps up a bit, although it still was not too heavy. Just don't completely sleep on it. I would love to have seen a larger focus on the ML section and I believe Professor Balch has indicated he may do so in the future. This is a good class to consider pairing up with a harder class.\nFinally, Professor Balch was awesome. He was amazingly active on the forums, held many office hour sessions, and overall just seemed genuinely interested in giving us the best learning experience possible.",

Agree with comments I have read so far and I'll add my take.\nClass spends one third teaching you Python/Numpy/Pandas. Professor already indicated that will shrink that part. I'd feel torn at leaving it out. I had already taken the ML class and had to decide by myself if to learn R or Python while at the same time going through lectures and that was painful. So overall I'm on the side of leaving that part in but shortening it.\nI loved that professor asked to implement everything ourselves without relying to any library (other than numpy/pandas). There's nothing like implementing an algorithm yourself. Even something as simple as KNN has its tricks when implementing it.\nI loved that the assignments were somehow at par with the class. Every assignment is an increment over the last one. You get to build your own market simulator (or backtester). Stock trading strategies and then ML algorithms for it.\nProfessor was incredibly engaged throughout the class. He hosts several hangouts of an hour or more himself. He's amazingly active in piazza. Piazza becomes a firehose of posts and the professor replied to at least one third of them with followups.\nIf there would be a second part for this class I'd definitely sign up!",

For example, marketsim. py: there is no way you are getting that assignment working without the office hours (which has nearly line-by-line pseudocode). On the KNN assignment, the assignment page did not clearly specify the runtime requirement, so I ended up rewriting my solution. Etc and so on. The course work was way out of balance, with the first half (or so) of the course having almost no work and the last half being heavily loaded. Also, I felt like the list of hundreds of questions to "study" for the midterm was counterproductive, as these questions were student written and just generally hard to parse. A lot of my frustration came from Pandas (a python module) which has a really annoying and backwards API and doesn\'t adhere to the way things are generally done in Python. Overall I spent hours and hours googling ways to do stuff in Pandas, reading piazza, pouring over the assignment docs, etc, which just somehow doesn\'t feel really rewarding.',

I don't know how you all managed that, but this shows the dedication with which you all work and value your job. Congratulations!\nAny feedback without mentioning the lecture videos would, to me, be unfair. For ML videos to be not boring is a monumental task, but I, and I think remaining class shares this sentiment, rather enjoyed them and would listen to them in extended sessions. So, Congatulations on that too!\nThe assignments about 80/85% of the time are well managed and well explained, with a clear rubric set for students to meet. In comparison to other better-managed classes, I'd rate this aspect of the class up there with the best.\nOn the improvement side, I'd personally like to see following:\nMid-term question creation should be replaced with better directed assignments/projects. I didn't see any value in them. Sorry :(\nSome might not agree with me, but I think first mini-course should be left for students to explore. I'd rather start with Mini Course 2 and ML part immediately afterwards\nRight now, the course gives a touch of ML for Trading systems. I think this leaves room for more \"in-class\" experimentation. Perhaps more algorithms, ideas etc... I'd rank this course from easy-to-medium difficulty; but, I think it should be, with some more directed effort towards ML and its experimentation with Trading systems, medium-to-high difficulty range.\nLecture videos are so good that I would love to see more of them. Other ML algorithms, their analysis etc... Perhaps students don't have to be assigned tasks from them if it becomes too much, but still they can always see them and learn from them in their free time.\nI have had great fun with this course, and I hope everyone else has too.",

It became more or less like the KBAI project where all the pieces you built (simulator, strategy, ML algorithms, training/testing harness) have to be ready to go for the final project. Any bug from the previous projects is going to cost you time in debugging. Also this class is also going toward automated grading testcases, so without test harness, I could see many people have trouble getting good grade on their projects. Had all the optional parts (implement boosting, ling and knn analysis, all parts of the final project scaled evenly) and test harness not allowed to share, i could see the whole class drops half-to-one letter grade average. By the look of the grade of final project, probably less than 15% people actually implemented QLearning trades generator, which is really the whole point of the class.\nToward the end, you are building a QLearning agent to do automated trades generation, which is quite cool to detach QLearning from the more common "robot in a maze" application. The future offering is likely to disperse the loads a bit more so the end project isn\'t so compressed where the common time working on them is upward of 30-40 hours. The future iteration also going to bring back Decision tree next semester, and "deep learning" at some point. This course has the potential to mature into a really good course.',

This class won't teach you advanced concepts around the stock market or ML but it gives you a solid base to build on. One of the pieces I really enjoyed was implementing the ML algorithms vs. just using them from a library like scikit. This class is all in python (which can be good/bad). As I already was familiar with python, the first couple of weeks were fairly easy other than learning the ins and outs of the numpy and pandas libraries. The projects definitely ramped up as the class went on but I really liked how the professor made each project build on top of each other. As long as you stay on top of your projects, build out your projects modularly, comment your code well, and don't overly procrastinate this class should be relatively straightforward. The midterm can be a bit tricky with the programming problems but the professor did provide a great study guide - use this and you will do fine on the midterm! Also, Professor Balch is extremely active on Piazza which was a nice surprise (I was not expecting this).

            review: "Unlike some others who have stated this class was super easy, I will contrast and state I thought it was very challenging. I would not consider it hard, but it was very time consuming, especially toward the end. The first several weeks are no more than a few hours week. After the midterm, the projects get very difficult and toward the end, I was spending upward of 40 hours a week working on them. The first few assignments are very much 'hand holding' to give you direction. The last few are much more like real world programming assignments where you are given a task without much direction and have to figure out how to do it. Expect to spend lots of time Googling.\nThe first half of the class was easy as it slowly allowed you piece by piece to assemble the final projects. The interesting thing about this class compared to any other I have taken was that everything builds on top of what you have previously done. You will insert code you wrote at the beginning of the course into the final assignments. One piece of advice I will give is to make sure everything you write is commented correctly and modular enough to be copy/pasted into another file as you will do this almost every week.\nOne thing I did hate in the course was the midterm. It was very difficult (I got a high C. ) The reason for this is that half questions come right out of Professor Balch's book, and the other half are programming questions. (ex. What is the output of dFTrading[:, 1, 'IBM']) I have never in my life taken a programming test on paper like this. I can figure that kind of stuff out all day long on a computer but struggled to do it in a multiple choice exam.\nOverall I really did like the class. I have an interest in the stock market, so the material was right up my alley. If you find finance boring you will likely not get as much out of it. Make sure you have at least intermediate level Python skills. Brush up on Numpy and Pandas before taking the class and you will do well.",

If you are already an expert in all of those areas then this course will probably not be very informative, but otherwise the course should work well as a first look at those topics. Especially if you are a novice programmer, I would recommend this as one of the few in the OMS program that involves a lot of coding but does not assume much previous coding experience. In terms of both finance and machine learning, only the very basics are covered, but you will get practical experience working with both in the assignments which can help if you decide to pursue each further in the future (such as by taking the Machine Learning course).\nIn terms of the course structure, it is heavily programming project-based. The early assignments are very simple but the later assignments become more involved and give more room to go beyond the minimum requirements for extra credit. In the semester I took the course, there were many major problems with grading the assignments which was the only major downside of the course in general. Assuming those issues are resolved for future semesters, the assignments overall are fun and apply the material from the course well. The course was supposed to have both a midterm and a final exam, but the final exam was cancelled due to logistical reasons. The midterm exam was fair in terms of questions although it did involve a lot of memorization for things like library API details and financial formulas.\nOverall I would say that if you are interesting in learning the basics of these topics and like working on small programming projects this course is a good choice.',

These will most ofteb be less than 20 lines of python, but code-reuse is common from lab to lab, so bugs will quickly propagate and cause headaches later. The lectures are interesting, if a bit slow. Overall they illustrate the concepts well and make the labs straightforward.\nTake this class with a more difficult one- I took it alongside CSE 6220 and found the balance to be excellent.',

The projects in the final machine learning mini-course get a little more tricky. I was basically watching four or five lectures the day before the assignment was due, not having any problems, coding the project, and getting solid marks. Do NOT try to do that in the ML portion of the course.\nThe ML concepts are not difficult, but the projects can take a little work to get right. I probably spent ~16 to ~24 hours on each of the final three projects. Consider me your own personal Jacob Marley, coming back from beyond the semester warning you to do as you should, and not what I did. Respect the final mini-course, and you'll be fine.",

            review: "This has been a very interesting course... mainly because I've had some business background and have had an interest in computational finance. The projects have definitely been beneficial, but the organization/timeliness of the course team and how/when these projects were presented and what they actually covered was a bit disappointing. Yes, it was the first semester this was offered, so I expected it to be imperfect and feel the students have had grace for that. Going into the semester, I was thinking that between the two brand new courses I was taking, this would be the more organized b/c the instructor had taught this multiple semesters, already had a class website, and had an environment already setup. Another of the disappointments I have had are that many of the final projects have been filled with coding the underlying ML algorithms from scratch rather than actually applying ML to the quantitative finance domain. It seemed that ML knowledge was prerequisite for the course, so I therefore thought that's what the course was about. I'd expect some of this implementation of the basic workhorse algorithms in ML to be in an ML class... kind of like our implementation requirements of 7641. With that mindset, it seemed rather frustrating to receive project assignments approx. 1 week prior to the due date that were requiring this type of development... and again, not necessarily tied-to the trading / computational finance domain. I wish we could have spent the time working on some of the things that the extra credit proposed instead of working on developing my own KNN learner, bag (bootstrap aggregator) learner, Qlearner, or Dyna.\n... All that said, it really was a great class and I learned a lot. I actually began really liking Python through this course... it's mandatory, so be ready. Those taking the class do come away with a decent set of software that could be further developed to make a nice personal trading system.... or, if motivated enough, I suppose you could even start your own hedge fund.",

You will definitely learn a lot if you take it, both in terms of how to think about financial data, some financial concepts, how to work with Python libraries (especially NumPy and Pandas), and some machine learning topics.\nI think this course would be a great course to take before Machine Learning, because it introduces you to the topic of machine learning in a more gentle manner than the Machine Learning course. I paired this course with Computability, Complexity, and Algorithms, and that worked out okay.\nEven though this course was not extremely hard, I actually feel like it is one of the better and more beneficial courses in the program. It is both highly practical and very enjoyable. And I think that is true even if you never write another piece of code having to do with trading after the class is over.\nOne thing to keep in mind. While the workload is lower during the beginning of the semester, the projects towards the end of the semester are significantly more time-consuming. So keep that in mind when considering your schedule.',

This is a fine course and most will enjoy it very much- I certainly did. The typical first-run course snafus with project definitions and scheduling were compounded by some medical problems that the instructor had during the semester, so our experience might not be all that representative going forward. That said, almost 2/3 of the semester were spent on just getting some basic concepts down for python and finance, and we didn't even approach any ML until almost November. The projects themselves were fine. Because of the problems that I mentioned, we had a short runway to complete some of the projects (we didn't get the description of one of the projects until after the planned due date had already passed), and they had to shuffle the syllabus around a bit to accommodate (including dropping the final exam). I assume that wont be a problem in future semesters. They went away from an autograded project to a written report on the later projects, and finishing the report proved to be time consuming for me. But they are flexible and provide 5 late days for projects that you can use however you want during the semester.\nGreat instructor and staff, and a fun course. You will enjoy it!",

            review: "The material here is interesting and I love the project structure. You gradually build up a Python module that includes all of your code from prior projects, ending up with a working market simulator that you can use to backtest trading strategies. That said, I feel the course suffers a bit from its Coursera background and desire to simultaneously be ML for finance students and finance for CS students. It's very, very easy, covering the very basics of portfolio management but only including long and short equity positions, nothing on derivatives, fixed income, FX. If you've used NumPy and pandas before, you can basically sleep through the first month of the course. I was hoping for more coverage of times series analysis and how to deal with non-IID samples, fat tails, heteroskedasticity, etc. , since we seem to just assume IID and approximately normal in developing ideas in the base ML course, but I guess this is a CS program, not a math or econ program. The other issue here is they're revamping the assignments on the go from what they used to be in the Coursera course, presumably to make them more challenging for grad students qualified to study at Georgia Tech, rather than the 10, 000 who used to take the course for free every few months, but they're not releasing them on-time and we've ended up with a great deal of dead time between finishing something and having nothing else to work on. Hopefully future iterations will get that worked out and involve a lot more programming.",
