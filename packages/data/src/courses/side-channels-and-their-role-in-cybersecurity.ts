            review: 'Interesting subject.  Projects are doable and interesting.  Recorded materials are good.\nInstructors hold office hours in the middle of the work day and will not record them.  Ed posts are never answered unless prompted by a student in office hours.  Emails to professors go unanswered.  Grades are very slow to be returned.  (Fall 2022 average return was 21 days with less than 10 students in the class.)  There is no TA.\nInstructors generally seem inconvenienced by teaching the class.',

            review: "I was very skeptical going into this class, however was very pleased with the materials as this exposed me to new and interesting attack channels which I was previously fully unaware of.  This was an optional class for me, and I'm very glad I chose to take it.\nThe workload was very reasonable and consistent with other courses in my program. The course is project based, with each project targeting a different technique.  Some projects are easy, a few are difficult, most are fun. Projects are practical in nature in that you're writing code to produce results, and documenting your approach in very light reports. The intent of the course is not learning to code, so in many cases skeleton code is provided to get you started.",

        'fall 2022':
            "The course covers an interesting subject, and the projects are both doable and engaging, with high-quality recorded materials. However, there are significant drawbacks, including instructors' limited availability, as office hours are scheduled during work hours and are not recorded. Student inquiries on Ed are often ignored unless addressed during office hours, and emails to professors typically go unanswered. Additionally, grading is sluggish, with an average return time of 21 days for a small class size. Overall, students feel that instructors appear more inconvenienced by teaching than genuinely invested in the course.",
        'spring 2021':
            'The course received positive feedback for introducing students to new and interesting attack channels, with participants expressing satisfaction with the materials provided. Many appreciated the reasonable workload, which was consistent with other classes in their program, and found the project-based structure engaging, with a mix of easy and challenging assignments that made learning enjoyable. However, some reviews suggest that students may have expected more emphasis on coding skills, as the intent of the course was not focused on coding proficiency. Overall, the practical nature of the projects and supportive framework contributed to a positive learning experience, despite some minor concerns about the depth of coding instruction.',
