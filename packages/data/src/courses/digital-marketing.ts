            review: "This review is for Summer 2024.\nThis was my final course in OMSCS after doing the ML spec with two classes per semester over the last year, and I'm pretty burnt out so it was welcome to have a very light workload. This class took me 1 hr / week with ~4 hours to prep for the two exams (so 2 hrs/week averaged out), and my final grade in Canvas is a 94%. You do have to pay ~$25 to buy a coursepack from Harvard Business School with the cases, so just be aware of that.\nThe lectures are high quality and provide a comprehensive albeit survey level intro to Digital Marketing. Most of the subjects in the course are relatively easy to grasp with just basic intuition, with the only technical subject matter being SEO in my opinion.\nThere are mini-case discussions, major-case discussions, and two exams (midterm and final). Mini-case discussions are easy 100s if you put in a modest amount of effort to articulate original thoughts on the case and participate in the discussion. Major-case discussions are also easy 100s if you answer the questions thoroughly and (again) show original insights and give it your best effort.\nThe midterm (I got a low B) is harder than the final (I got a high A) but both should feel like a victory lap if you've done any of the harder classes in the program. Neither required more than 4 hours of studying for me.\nThis course gets a 5/5 from me since everything is released ahead of time and there's great support from the staff and TAs. If you really wanted to, you could be done with the whole class in exactly a week, assuming a few of your peers are also working ahead at the same pace (since you'll need to respond to them on Canvas for discussions). This really allowed me to de-stress and enjoy my last OMSCS summer, especially after doubling GA with another class last semester.\nIf you have to use ChatGPT for this class, you don't deserve an MS in CS. Please be better than that.",

Mini-cases involve reading a short (about 1 page) case study from the textbook and writing a short (about 3 paragraphs) response to 3 questions. Major case reflections are longer versions of mini-cases in which you read a case study (5-15) and answer 3 long form questions (about 2-3 in total).\nThe midterm and final are closed note, 35 questions each, multiple choice and quite easy. I studied an average of 7.5 hours for these exams and averaged an 93%.

I don't need to be another voice in the choir about this...read the review below mine if you want the gist with some STEM elitism sprinkled in.\nWith that said, it was honestly a breath of fresh air and a genuinely interesting and fun course. I knew literally nothing about digital marketing aside from how to turn on uBlock Origin and how to unsubscribe from an email list going into this course-- and I had absolutely no idea what goes on with my company outside of cranking out tickets with my fellow developer coworkers.\nThis class, however, gave me an entirely new appreciation for the business side of software companies and some of the marketing tactics and strategic decisions that must be made in order to be successful in our industry. It was really fun to look at the industry from a different perspective and especially in such bite sized content relative to some of the other behemoths of classes I've taken before. Case studies were generally thought provoking and intriguing and a welcome break from coding.\nHighly recommend the course and also highly recommend not just mailing it in even though you totally can.",

            review: "I could have passed this course with an A as a 9th grader. It's super easy. The fact that it's a Masters level business course, blows my mind. Business students truly have a wildly different college experience.\nIt would actually require more effort to cheat with ChatGPT, than to just do the work. Yet, the path-of-least-resistance MBAs in the course still did that. The teacher constantly made announcements about the AI cheating. This course is discussion based and you could see that MBA students had literally just pasted the output of GPT into the submission and replies.\nThis class is literally about 1-1.5 hours per week of work for a STEM student. Especially if you aren't a terrible writer. Typically, each week there's 20-40 minutes of lecture and a discussion post + only 1 reply. That's it.\nThe lectures playing at any speed besides 2x are way too slow. So it's really 10-20 minutes of lecture each week. Nothing in the lecture content is really groundbreaking or informative. If you've been an Internet user since you were a kid, most things are just common sense and intuitive. It feels like the course was made for older people who are comparatively new to the internet.\nSome weeks, in place of normal course content, there's a 2 page paper in the course. The paper is Q&A format. This should also take you about an hour if you are a good writer. There are 5 weeks where this happens. None of the writing in the class has much formality and it's practically just explanatory writing. It's also largely opinion based commentary.\nI'm in week 12 and I haven't received anything besides a 100 on every assignment besides the midterm. I took the test blind and got a high B. The two tests, midterm and final, are worth 30% of your grade a piece. They aren't particularly challenging, but there are some questions that require specific knowledge and can't be answered intuitively. I would just recommend quickly rewatching the lectures for each test before taking. This is what I will be doing before the final.\nIt's probably in the top 3 easiest courses I've ever taken across my entire education. You could take 3 classes if this is one of them. I heard about people speed running the course and can completely see how that's possible. There's so little work that I had to put a notification in my phone one day per week to remind me to get the work out of the way. Otherwise I'd forget about it.\nGood luck! But if you're a STEM masters student, you don't need it.",

Such as make a small ad campaign and get certain results rather than just abstractly commenting on cases. Writing comments just seems a bit of an exercise in BSing. It would have been better for me to have assignments where I have to design a campaign and suggest some search words and test them out on google and get some real world results.",

I am a small business owner and was working on my own website on Squarespace concurrent to taking this course.  I give this class a 5/5 for the different tools it taught me in terms of search engine optimization and image tags and whatnot.  There is great practical knowledge being offered up within the different modules if you can find out how to apply it within your own life - namely within modes of advertising online and search engine optimization.\n\n\nMy hours devoted per week to the course were around 10, much higher than I anticipated based on prior stats.  I am sure that students were able to receive a good grade without really reading the textbook alongside the lectures, but if you are going to read the textbook and take notes, you should expect around the same time allotment.\n\n\nI frontloaded the course (all modules open up at the start of the semester) and was finished with everything with a month to spare.  Great for pairing with a tougher course.\n\n\nEverything is this class is fair: exams, homeworks, case studies.  All requirements are explicitly explained.  If you do poorly on something, I would assume its your own fault.\n\n\nConclusion - Great course.  Would recommend.',

In terms of overall difficulty, the course content is not hard to understand and the time investment is minimal (~5hrs/wk on average).

If you are in that track, you better take it and not try to skive around by taking low-value classes like 88x3, where x =/= 0.\nTake this class seriously, guys. Even though the workload is low, it\'s meant to be like that so you can easily experiment things in real life, and worry less about the grades. Think of this as an CS 8001 seminar but with 3 credit hours and easily creditable as an elective. My reported workload reflects the time used for minor case, major case, exams and field experiments (which are ungraded, but hey, they are great life hecks!).\nMy honest comment is that, do not attempt to cheat and try to use "other sources" to copy and paste the comments on the cases. They do use TurnItIn, but extremely discreetly and blacklist you until you realize it too late into the semester. Same goes for the exams - Michael Buchanan does refresh his videos here and there each semester, so you will be in for a nasty surprise. Another option they might use is that they can track which student did not pay for the case study package, from there, they would easily know who are the ones who obtained it from those "ahem" sources. Do a combination of these, and the OSI would come knocking on your door.\nI learned the ideas of Digital Marketing and put them onto an experiment onto my Tinder account. My number of likes did increase exponentially. I know this is a humble brag but a brag nonetheless - but hey, things actually do work.\nMichael Buchanan is a leading practitioner in the field. Attend his office hours, they are a gem.',

            review: 'This is a very easy class. However, easy does not mean you won’t learn a lot. It’s been one of my favorite courses so far because it felt like the intersection of computing and business. Mid term and final are heavily weighted and can drop your grade even if you get 100% on every other assignment. It pairs very well with other classes and I would definitely take this class again.',

            review: "I enjoyed this class! I think it's increasingly relevant and good knowledge to have no matter what your role is in your job since all companies do digital marketing to some degree.\nI would recommend reading the lecture transcripts and following along with the powerpoint slides vs listening to the lectures. It goes much faster this way. I did read all the lecture material week-by-week but I did NOT take notes in a notebook as I went. Before the tests, I reread all the transcripts again and created a Quizlet set which I used to study.\nThere are weekly homeworks, most of which are \"short case studies\" from the textbook where you answer a few questions in a post on Canvas and then comment on another student's response. These were fairly quick to do. It's just important to keep up with them as you had to post by Thursday night and comment by Sunday evening. Most people just immediately commented after they posted and I would recommend that.\nThe other weekly homework assignments were five \"major case studies.\" These all fell on weeks without lectures which was helpful. These required a 2-4 page response and did take longer than the short case study responses but weren't too bad. Note: some students got caught for plagiarism on these cases so beware they check for that.\nI did feel like with all the homework assignments I was kind of making up a response based on common sense and my own experiences. I would read the lectures first and sometimes draw facts from them but oftentimes I was drawing on my own experiences and intuition more.\nI viewed the class as the lectures being the main material and the textbook being supplementary, but Professor Buchanan did say on piazza before the final that the textbook chapters were required reading. I didn't see them as necessary for most of the semester until I was taking the final and felt like some of the questions did not come from the lectures and must have only been in the textbook. So beware of that! I still made a 95% in the class, though!",

They are worth 30% each, for a total of 60% of your grade. A single question wrong may mean 1-2% of your final grade. They are not hard but I did not think they were a cakewalk either. I got a high A on the first one and a high B on the second one. I did have to sit down and memorize a bunch of stuff for them for several hours. You may be able to get decent scores without studying through process of elimination, but it will probably not be a fun experience.',

A little further effort is needed to read parts of the textbook for some random questions on the exam, so I would recommend taking a quick look at some of the more complex topics in the book.\nI finished almost all of this course in 3 days, I basically sat down the first weekend for a marathon session and blasted through everything (I doubled up with the practicum this semester so wanted to get this class done as fast as possible). Definitely doable except you may need to wait for a couple of weeks for other students to catch up so you can write discussion responses to them.\nIf you are at all interested in the business side of things this is a fairly interesting class and I would recommend it.',

            review: "Most of the other reviews for this course are accurate. It's a solid digital marketing class. Even if you're in the industry, it's great to fill in some of the gaps on things that you may not know much about (i.e. I work at Google, so many of the lessons on Search, Display, and Video were less relevant to me. That said, I did learn quite a bit in the Social Media and Email modules, and it was also helpful to holistically see the digital plane from a marketer's perspective).\nThe class is easy, which shouldn't come as a surprise. Max 5 hours of work per week, and that's only if you have a Major Case due. I got an A despite never looking at the textbook (I did watch and take notes during all the lectures and study them). I took this class alone during a personally tumultuous semester (moved across the country) and I probably still could have handled a second more quantitative class alongside it. That said, still glad I took it.\nAlso, I didn't take advantage of this, but the fact that the class is self-paced (i.e. all material is released on day 1, so you could hypothetically take the entire class in a few intense days) is a really nice plus. I would have preferred this in earlier semesters when I had midterms/finals occurring the same week as weddings and job interviews.",

            review: 'This course has a good reputation, and it is well earned.  I enjoyed this class almost as much as Simulation.  The course covers the basics of digital marketing (paid ads, organic search/SEO, paid search, video, email, social, etc.). The course involved 5 major business case reviews, and 10 minor ones.  The minor business case reviews were about 1 hour of work, plus writing one peer review.  The major business cases were a few hours, and no peer reviews.  There were 2 exams including one midterm and one non-cumulative final.  The exams were a total of 60% of the grade, and the business case write-ups the remaining 40%.  Study involved watching the very well done videos, reading the pretty good (but not great) textbook, which is free online as a PDF.  The instructor is passionate about the subject, an excellent communicator and was engaged and present for the office hours in person.  Office hours are offered twice per week.  The TA’s were pretty much behind the scenes, but no complaints.  The course opens completely on the first day, so you can go at the scheduled pace, or move faster if you wish.  I stuck with the regular pace for the first couple of weeks, and then just put my head down and finished the entire thing in about half a summer session.  I did OK on the midterm.  I studied much harder for the final and managed a 100%.  (This was my first and only 100% on a proctored test in the  OMSA program.  I hate proctored exams!)   This course is not hard, but some study is required.  You cannot just float by even if you are familiar with the topic.  I thought I was, and I still did learn things in this course.  Again, a nice course.  This was my final course in the OMSA.  I believe I will get an A.  (A majority of students do.)',

If you are new to digital marketing, this is a great course to acquire the principles as it goes over a new topic in digital marketing each week. Didn't quite live up to the level of a graduate class in an analytics program in my opinion, but I knew this coming in from the course description and reviews. Don't expect this class to have applied practice of digital marketing analytics for analysis. It is a good class to learn the concepts, tools, and examples in digital marketing. All the course content is available from the beginning so the class is flexible and overall a very easy class.",

            review: 'This is a good course to learn about marketing, as applied through digital channels - a few are email, social media, mobile and video. Each week, we learn about a channel - features, benefits, and some associated costs.\nFor each topic, there is an associated "mini case" -  a look at how a company used a channel to reach a goal - sometimes the objective of marketing is not just "more sales".\nIn addition to these, there are 5 major cases - a more in-depth look at a marketing case study. What I like about these is it got me to think about the approach, and do some outside searching to learn more.\nThere are 2 exams, each worth 30%. Each was about 35 multiple-choice questions. It\'s a little unsettling going into the exam, because it\'s closed book and there are no "practice tests" to get an idea of what to expect. But I found out that if I had read the assignments and watched the lectures, I was able to answer most of them without feeling tricked.\nThese are topics which I feel I can put to use in our business.\nThe professor, Michael Buchanan, was active in the Piazza forum and ran all of the office hour sessions (there were 2 each week). He enjoys talking about marketing and other topics - even topics which are not directly related to the coursework.\nOne nice thing - all course lectures and assignments were released at the beginning of the semester, so we can work ahead as fast as we want. This would help students who are concerned with scheduling class around family or work events.',

The instructor is fabulous and lectures are very to the point.\nWorkload is comparatively light but who says students need to grind hard to learn and complete a degree while working full time and having families (at least in my case). I wish there were such courses in OMSCS as well.\nThis course has two exams. Each of these exams carry 30% marks and essential to doing well in the course. You need to watch lectures and read dedicated chapters from text book for exams. Most likely if you don't prepare hard but attempt everything in course you should end up with B or best case - A.\nRest of 40% marks come from weekly discussions or case studies which I really enjoyed.\nI highly recommend. Its a great course whether you want to pair it with other on just want to learn about digital marketing.",

Present throughout the course in canvas and piazza, friendly and welcoming. TAs are great too.  My only regret is that I could not find enough time for interactions. If you are completely new to digital marketing, I think there is a lot of things to learn. Two short proctored exams, non cumulative, closed book, can be finished < 1 hour.\nCons: From an OMSCS perspective, not comparable to the heavyweight courses that you usually get for the same fees. It is an easy A, and there are definitely things to be learned, but in the end I am left with a feeling that I cheated a bit by taking one of the easiest OMSA courses. But yeah definitely a great course to relax a bit and prevent OMSCS burnout, it was a better option to me compared to skipping a term.\nTextbook: The RedYellow textbook could be a valuable resource , depending on what you are trying to achieve. But it is very verbose and occasionally resembles something that an average copywriter would write to fluff up a bullet list to 10 pages- things like "20 benefits of mobile channel". Most of which are common-sense stuff. If you already have a big-picture idea how digital marketing works, you will have to actively fight boredom and sleep if you try to go through all chapters and lectures before the exam. (which you can actually postpone until right before the exam, since the weekly assignments are based on case studies in the textbook and the paid HBR case studies, and does not "require" the lectures or chapters per se. I did it successfully for weeks 7-13 and should be possible for weeks 1-6 as well)',

It is - and I would have known this had I read these reviews or looked at the syllabus - basically an overview of digital marketing areas and types, something you could broadly take away from just reading the textbook utilized heavily in the course.\nSo a missed opportunity in my mind to take a business course into a more technical and applied (and thus interesting) area of analysis.  But for what it was it was still interesting. The lectures are good, and the weekly mini and every 3 week larger case studies did require some applied thought.  It is quite easy though, and the two multiple-choice (<30 minute) exams are written in such a way that even a cursory understanding of the material would be enough to get an 80 (and also nearly memorizing everything would still make it tough to exceed a 95).

This is great if you want to go into this field, but not terribly helpful if you have no interest.\nBottom line: Take this course if you think you might be interested in a career in digital marketing analytics.
