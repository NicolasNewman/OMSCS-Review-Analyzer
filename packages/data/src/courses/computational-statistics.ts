        'This class describes the available knowledge regarding statistical computing. Topics include random deviates generation, importance sampling, Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC), EM algorithms, bootstrapping, model selection criteria, (e.g. C-p, AIC, etc.) splines, wavelets, and Fourier transform.',

            review: "What this course is: a survey of elementary machine learning methods that mostly aren't the current state of practice with. You'll code some short implementations, write some proofs, and do a project which involves writing a report and a full model implementation. If you are completely new to machine learning, I'd recommend this course. If you've been doing machine learning for a few years, and want to become more proficient with current methodologies like deep learning or gradient boosting machines, don't take this course.",
